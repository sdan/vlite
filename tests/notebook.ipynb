      "3 Model Architecture\n",
      "Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,29].\n",
      "Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1;:::;x n)to a sequence\n",

      "masking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\n",
      "predictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\n",
      "3.2 Attention\n",
      "An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\n",
      "where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\n",

      "values.\n",
      "In practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\n",

      "The two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\n",
      "plicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\n",
      "of1pdk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\n",
      "a single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\n",
      "much faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\n",
      "matrix multiplication code.\n",
      "While for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\n",
      "dot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\n",
      "dk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\n",
      "extremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1pdk.\n",
      "3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\n",
      "Instead of performing a single attention function with dmodel -dimensional keys, values and queries,\n",
      "we found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\n",
      "linear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\n",

      "The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\n",
      "\u000fIn \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\n",
      "and the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\n",

      "of the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\n",
      "3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\n",
      "In addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\n",
      "connected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\n",
      "consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\n",
      "FFN(x) = max(0 ;xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\n",
      "While the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\n",
      "from layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\n",
      "The dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\n",
      "dff= 2048 .\n",
      "3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\n",

      "layer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\n",
      "consider three desiderata.\n",
      "One is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\n",
      "be parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\n",
      "The third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\n",
      "dependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\n",
      "ability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\n",
      "traverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\n",
      "and output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 11]. Hence we also compare\n",
      "the maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\n",
      "different layer types.\n",
      "As noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\n",
      "executed operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\n",
      "computational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\n",
      "lengthnis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\n",
      "sentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\n",
      "[31] and byte-pair [ 25] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\n",
      "very long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\n",
      "6the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\n",
      "path length to O(n=r ). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\n",
      "A single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\n",
      "positions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n=k )convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\n",

      "were written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\n",
      "used beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty \u000b= 0:6[31]. These hyperparameters\n",
      "were chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\n",

      "In this work, we presented the Transformer, the ﬁrst sequence transduction model based entirely on\n",
      "attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\n",
      "multi-headed self-attention.\n",
      "For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained signiﬁcantly faster than architectures based\n",
      "on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\n",
      "English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\n",
      "model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\n",
      "We are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\n",
      "plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\n",
      "to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\n",
      "such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\n",

Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [31, 21, 13]. *Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented',\n",
       " ' with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and efficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating our research. † Work performed while at Google Brain. † Work performed while at Google Research. 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.']"

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. 1 Introduction Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29, 2, 5].

Gomez* ↑ Łukasz Kaiser* Google Research University of Toronto Google Brain llion@google.com aidan@cs.toronto.edu lukaszkaiser@google.com Illia Polosukhin* † illia.polosukhin@gmail.com Abstract The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English- to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. 1 Introduction Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [29, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [31, 21, 13]. *Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started the effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and has been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head attention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every detail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and tensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and efficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and implementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating our research. † Work performed while at Google Brain. † Work performed while at Google Research. 31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.\n"
