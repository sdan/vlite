Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Tesla Motors,” “Tesla,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” in this prospectus refer to Tesla Motors, Inc., and its subsidiaries and “Tesla store” means Tesla retail locations as well as Tesla galleries where we show potential customers our vehicles but do not consummate sales.
Overview
We design, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We have intentionally departed from the traditional automotive industry model by both exclusively focusing on electric powertrain technology and owning our vehicle sales and service network. We are the first and currently only company to commercially produce a federally-compliant highway-capable electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which combines a market-leading range on a single charge with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. Introducing the Tesla Roadster required us to develop a proprietary electric powertrain that incorporates four key components—an advanced battery pack, power electronics module, high-efficiency motor and extensive control software. We believe our core intellectual property contained within our electric powertrain will form the foundation for our planned future vehicles. Since our team combines the innovation and speed to market characteristics of Silicon Valley firms with the experience of leading automotive companies, we believe that we will be able to rapidly and cost effectively introduce additional vehicles, such as our planned Tesla Model S sedan, and stay at the forefront of the electric automobile industry.
We operate in a fundamentally different manner and structure than traditional automobile manufacturers to pursue what we believe is a historic opportunity – to create an integrated company which successfully commercializes electric vehicles without compromising on range, performance or styling. In addition to designing and manufacturing our vehicles, we sell and service them through our own sales and service network. This is different from the incumbent automobile companies in the United States who typically franchise their sales and service. We believe our approach will enable us to operate more cost effectively, provide a better experience for our customers and incorporate customer feedback more quickly into our product development and manufacturing processes. We are continuing to expand our distribution network globally and currently operate a total of 10 Tesla stores in North America and Europe.
The Tesla Roadster, our first vehicle, showcases our technology and illustrates our leadership in electric vehicle innovation. Introduced in 2008, the Tesla Roadster can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds, but produces zero tailpipe emissions. The Tesla Roadster has a battery pack capable of storing approximately 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack. The Tesla Roadster has a range of 236 miles on a single charge, as determined by an independent third party using the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s, or EPA’s, combined two-cycle city/highway test. Recently, the EPA announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. The Tesla Roadster reportedly set a new world distance record of 313 miles for a production electric car in a rally across Australia as part of the 2009 Global Green Challenge. To date, our customers have driven their Tesla Roadsters an estimated 3.0 million miles.

As of December 31, 2009 we had sold 937 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 18 countries. In July 2009, less than one year after the date of the commercial introduction of the Tesla Roadster, we introduced a new Roadster model, the Tesla Roadster 2, with improved electric powertrain performance and interior styling, and lower production costs. At the same time we introduced the Roadster Sport, which accelerates from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.7 seconds. We delivered our first right-hand drive version of the Tesla Roadster in January 2010, which we believe further demonstrates our ability to rapidly launch new products.
We intend to continue to develop our electric powertrain technology and introduce additional vehicles, such as our planned Model S sedan. We are designing the Model S to be a four door, five passenger premium sedan that offers exceptional performance, functionality and attractive styling with zero tailpipe emissions at a compelling cost of ownership. We are designing the Model S to include a third row with two rear-facing child seats, subject to applicable safety regulations and requirements, allowing us to offer a seven passenger sedan. The drivable early prototype of the Model S was revealed to the public in March 2009 and despite a limited marketing effort, as of December 31, 2009, we had received approximately 2,000 customer reservations with a minimum refundable payment of $5,000.
The Model S, which is planned to compete in the premium sedan market, is intended to have a significantly broader customer base than the Tesla Roadster. We currently intend to begin volume production of the Model S in 2012 with a target annual production of up to approximately 20,000 cars per year. We currently anticipate introducing the base Model S at an effective price of $49,900 in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even without this tax credit, we believe the Model S will be competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium sedans.
In order to meet customer range expectations, we are designing the planned Model S to offer a variety of range options from 160 miles to 300 miles on a single charge, as projected using the EPA’s combined two-cycle city/highway test. The EPA has announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. The Model S is being designed to be charged at home, but we are also planning to offer the capability to fast charge the vehicle in as little as forty-five minutes at commercial charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future. The Model S battery pack is also being designed with the capability of being rapidly swapped out at specialized commercial battery pack exchange facilities that we anticipate may be available in the future.
We are designing the Model S to have an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain in order to allow us to efficiently create other electric vehicles, which may include a sport utility vehicle, commercial van or a coupe. By developing our future vehicles from this common platform, we believe we can reduce their development time, and therefore reduce the required additional capital investment. Our long-term goal is to offer consumers a full range of electric vehicles, including a product line at a lower price point than the planned Model S.
We have developed a purpose-built electric powertrain to deliver the performance objectives of the Tesla Roadster and our planned future vehicles. The battery pack has been designed to use high volume lithium-ion battery cells and allows for flexibility with respect to specific lithium-ion chemistry and battery cell manufacturers. This enables us to leverage the significant investments being made globally by the battery industry to improve battery cell performance and lower cost. Harnessing the energy of a large number of lithium-ion battery cells into an electric vehicle required us to develop sophisticated battery cooling, power, safety and management systems. Delivering the instant power and torque of electric technology also required us to develop a proprietary alternating current 3-phase induction motor and its associated power electronics. In addition, we developed extensive software systems to manage the overall efficiency, safety and controls of the

Tesla Roadster and our planned future vehicles. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio. By utilizing a combination of standard components and innovative technology, we believe we have engineered what is currently the lowest cost battery pack when measured as a function of cost per kilowatt-hour.
Our electric powertrain is modular and compact, with fewer moving parts than an internal combustion engine, which we believe will enable us to easily adapt the technology to a variety of vehicle applications. We have developed a relationship with Daimler AG, or Daimler, since March 2008 to apply our technology in a battery pack and charger for Daimler’s Smart fortwo electric vehicle. We have been selected by Daimler to supply it with up to 1,000 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the Smart fortwo electric vehicle in five European cities. We began shipping the first of these battery packs and chargers in November 2009 and started to recognize revenue for these sales in the quarter ended December 31, 2009. We intend to expand our electric powertrain production facility in Palo Alto, California to develop and market powertrain components to Daimler and other automobile manufacturers.
We have entered into a $465.0 million long-term loan under the United States Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program which will be used to finance the development of a planned integrated manufacturing facility for the Model S as well as our electric powertrain production facility. We also have been granted up to approximately $31 million in tax incentives by the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority. We believe these loans and incentives will help accelerate the time to volume production for both the planned Model S and our electric powertrain business. In addition, we believe these loans and incentives provide us significant long-term financing that should enable us to focus more of our resources on the execution of our business plans.
We were incorporated in 2003 and began selling the Tesla Roadster in 2008. As of December 31, 2009 we had 514 employees worldwide.
Since inception through September 30, 2009, we have generated $108.2 million in revenue. As of September 30, 2009, we had an accumulated deficit of $236.4 million and had experienced net losses of $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $82.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, and $31.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
Industry Overview
We believe incumbent automobile manufacturers are at a crossroads and face significant industry-wide challenges. The reliance on the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine as the principal automobile powertrain technology has raised environmental concerns, created dependence among industrialized and developing nations on oil largely imported from foreign nations and exposed consumers to volatile fuel prices. In addition, we believe the legacy investments made by incumbent automobile manufacturers in manufacturing and technology related to the internal combustion engine have to date inhibited rapid innovation in alternative fuel powertrain technologies.
We believe that shifting consumer preferences together with increasing government regulation and incentives will result in significant growth in the market for electric vehicles. We believe many consumers are increasingly willing to consider buying electric-based vehicles due to the environmental, economic and national security consequences of using gasoline-powered vehicles, as demonstrated by the increased sales of hybrid electric vehicles in recent years. We also believe government regulations and incentives are accelerating the growth of the electric vehicle market. Many governments in countries throughout the world are regulating vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards and offering incentives to consumers to purchase more energy efficient vehicles. According to Frost & Sullivan, a business research and consulting firm, the market for electric-

Table of Contents

based vehicles, which includes electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, is expected to grow to approximately 10.6 million units worldwide, or approximately 14% of new vehicles sold by 2015 from approximately 1.75 million units or 3% of new vehicles sold in 2008.
We believe incumbent automobile manufacturers face significant challenges that will continue to inhibit their ability to capitalize fully on the electric vehicle opportunity, including:
 
 	•	 	
Dependence on the Internal Combustion Engine. We believe many incumbent automobile manufacturers have to date failed to aggressively pursue alternative fuel vehicle programs because of their continued need to invest in internal combustion engine technologies that support their existing revenue base and core competencies.

 
 	•	 	
Limited Electric Powertrain Expertise. To date, many incumbent automobile manufacturers have pursued multiple alternative fuel programs and, in doing so, have outsourced key components of alternative fuel powertrain development. By exploring a diverse range of alternative fuel programs while simultaneously continuing to invest in the internal combustion engine, we believe incumbent automobile manufacturers have diluted their efforts to build competencies in a specific alternative fuel powertrain technology such as electric powertrains.

 
 	•	 	
Profitability Pressures and Reduced Operating Flexibility. Many incumbent automobile manufacturers have recently faced deteriorating margins and liquidity, which we believe has significantly reduced their operating flexibility and their ability to invest in alternative fuel programs that they may not view as their core business.

 
 	•	 	
Long and Expensive New Product Development Process. New product launches by incumbent automobile manufacturers from development to production are often lengthy and require significant capital investments.

Despite the automobile industry’s challenges, incumbent automobile manufacturers have attempted over time to respond to shifting consumer desires and government mandates by incorporating elements of electric propulsion into their vehicles by introducing hybrid powertrains. Although hybrid electric vehicles address some of the concerns associated with the historical reliance on the internal combustion engine, we believe they are a transitional technology between internal combustion engine vehicles and fully electric vehicles. The increased complexity and weight of the dual powertrain system inherent in hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles forces engineering compromises which result in a less energy efficient vehicle and generally limits performance. Consequently, these hybrid vehicles do not realize the full benefits of electric propulsion, and still consume gasoline and produce emissions. While incumbent automobile manufacturers may recognize the benefits of electric propulsion, we believe that due to technology limitations and their relatively limited expertise in battery, software, and electric powertrain technologies, incumbent automobile manufacturers have to date been unable to design and offer a commercially successful electric vehicle that offers compelling range, vehicle design and performance at an affordable cost.
Our Solution
We design, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components through our highly differentiated business model. We intend to leverage our proprietary electric powertrain system developed for the Tesla Roadster to form the basis for our planned Model S sedan. We believe our combination of engineering and management expertise from Silicon Valley and the automotive industry, together with our operational structure, will help us to rapidly innovate and to cost efficiently introduce new vehicles and technologies. By owning our sales and service network, we believe we can offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues that incumbent automobile manufacturers do not receive in the traditional franchised dealer model. We also plan to

Table of Contents

leverage our electric powertrain technology to develop and sell powertrain components to other manufacturers, such as the battery packs and chargers we have recently begun to sell to Daimler.
We believe our proprietary electric powertrain system will enable us to design and develop zero emission vehicles that overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles. As a result, we believe customers of our vehicles will enjoy many benefits, including:
 
 	•	 	
Long Range and Recharging Flexibility. The Tesla Roadster has been designed to provide range capabilities significantly in excess of any current and prior generation electric vehicles. We are designing our planned Model S to offer a variety of intermediate range options as well as a range option extending beyond that of the Tesla Roadster. In addition, the Tesla Roadster incorporates our proprietary on-board charging system, permitting recharging from almost any available electrical outlet, and we are designing the Model S to offer fast charging capability from higher power electrical outlets.

 
 	•	 	
Energy Efficiency and Cost of Ownership. We believe our Tesla Roadster offers and our planned Model S will offer consumers an attractive cost of ownership when compared to similar internal combustion engine or hybrid electric vehicles. By using a single powertrain and customizing the systems within the electric powertrain and the rest of the vehicle, our vehicles are more energy efficient, and therefore less expensive to operate, than currently available hybrid or internal combustion engine vehicles.

 
 	•	 	
High-Performance Without Compromised Design or Functionality. With the Tesla Roadster, we believe we have been able to successfully overcome the design and performance tradeoff issues that encumbered earlier electric vehicle designs. We believe the Tesla Roadster offers our customers an unparalleled driving experience with instantaneous and sustained acceleration through an extended range of speed. We intend to apply such advancements to our future vehicles.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following strengths position us well to capitalize on the expected growth in the electric vehicle market:
 
 	•	 	
Singular Focus and Leadership in Electric Powertrain Technology. We are focused exclusively on developing our electric vehicles and electric powertrain technology to achieve a compelling combination of range and performance in our vehicles. We intend to use our electric powertrain expertise to innovate rapidly and sustain technological and time to market advantages over incumbent automobile manufacturers.

 
 	•	 	
Combination of Expertise from Silicon Valley and the Traditional Automotive Industry. Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, software and controls, which we have complemented with significant automotive expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing from other members or our team.

 
 	•	 	
Proprietary Systems Integration of Vehicle and Electric Powertrain. We believe that our ability to combine our electric powertrain expertise with our vehicle engineering expertise provides a broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration.

 
 	•	 	
Rapid Customer Focused Product Development. We have designed our product development process to rapidly react to data collected from our vehicles and the direct interaction with our customers at our company-owned stores, which we believe will enable us to rapidly introduce new vehicles and features.

 
 	•	 	
Ownership of Sales and Service Network. We intend for our distribution and service network to offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service

 
 
5
Table of Contents

 	
revenues incumbent automobile manufacturers do not generally receive in the traditional franchised distribution and service network model.
 
 	•	 	
Brand Leadership. We believe the Tesla brand is well recognized in our target market and is associated with high performance, long range electric vehicles, despite limited marketing spending to date. In November 2009, Advertising Age provided testament to our brand strength by selecting Tesla as one of “America’s hottest brands” in a special report highlighting the year’s 50 top brands.

 
 	•	 	
Substantial Funding in Place to Accelerate Growth. We believe our $465.0 million loan facility agreement under the United States Department of Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program provides significant long-term financing that will enable us to focus on executing our business plans.

 
 	•	 	
Capital Efficiency. We believe our rapid product development process, our modular and adaptable powertrain, our plan to design and manufacture multiple product types on a singular platform, and our ability to hold lower inventory levels while still meeting customer demand will help reduce the capital required to reach operating efficiencies. This approach is designed with the aim of allowing us to achieve profitability at relatively low volumes and create a viable long-term business.

Our Strategy
We intend to be a leading global manufacturer and direct seller of electric vehicles and electric vehicle technologies. Key elements of our strategy include:
 
 	•	 	
Successfully Launch the Model S. We believe the successful launch of the planned Model S is critical to our ability to capitalize on the electric vehicle market opportunity. We are currently executing a detailed plan to finish the design, engineering and component sourcing for the Model S and to build out the manufacturing facility and obtain the equipment to support its production with the goal of commercial introduction of the Model S in 2012.

 
 	•	 	
Use a Common Platform to Introduce New Models. We intend to design the Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain, to provide us the flexibility to use the Model S platform to cost efficiently launch new electric vehicle models subsequent to the start of production of the Model S.

 
 	•	 	
Develop Integrated Engineering and Manufacturing Capabilities. We intend to develop a substantially-integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility, allowing our design, vehicle engineering, and manufacturing teams to work alongside one another to streamline the feedback loop for rapid product enhancements and quality improvements.

 
 	•	 	
Continue to Focus on Technological Advancement and Cost Improvement. We intend to continue to further develop our proprietary electric powertrain system, specifically its range capabilities, while continuing to reduce its manufacturing cost.

 
 	•	 	
Expand our Company-Owned Sales and Service Network. As of December 31, 2009, we had opened 10 Tesla owned stores in the United States and Europe, and we plan to nearly double the number of Tesla stores opened by the end of 2010, with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within the next several years in connection with the planned Model S rollout.

 
 	•	 	
Leverage Industry Advancements in Battery Cells. We intend to leverage the substantial investments being made globally by battery cell manufacturers, as we have designed our powertrain technology to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry, form factor and vendor.

We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to fund planned capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes. Under our loan facility with the United States Department of Energy, which we refer to herein as our DOE Loan Facility, we have agreed to spend up to $33 million plus any cost overruns we may encounter in developing our anticipated powertrain and Model S manufacturing facilities. In addition to this obligation, we have agreed to set aside 50% of the net proceeds from this offering to fund a separate, dedicated account under our DOE Loan Facility to fund project costs for our anticipated powertrain and Model S manufacturing facilities that would otherwise have been funded through advances made under the DOE Loan Facility, which funds will be reimbursed by the DOE once they have been used in full. We currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of between $100 million and $125 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. See “Use of Proceeds.”
 
Directed share program
The underwriters have reserved for sale, at the initial public offering price, up to              shares of our common stock being offered for sale to business associates, employees and friends and family members of our employees and Tesla customers who have received delivery of a Tesla Roadster from Tesla. The number of shares available for sale to the general public in this offering will be reduced to the extent these persons purchase reserved shares. Any reserved shares not purchased will be offered by the underwriters to the general public on the same terms as the other shares.

(2)	In January 2010, we issued a warrant to the DOE in connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility to purchase shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock. This convertible preferred stock warrant will become a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock upon the closing of this offering. Beginning on December 15, 2018 and until December 14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the DOE Loan Facility during the prior quarter. Since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary, this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other income (expense), net, until its expiration or exercise. Potential common shares issuable upon exercise of the DOE warrant will be excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share of common stock until such time as we generate a net profit in a given period.
(3)	Our basic net loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares, excluding common shares subject to repurchase, and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of stock options to purchase common stock and warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock (using the treasury stock method) and the conversion of our convertible preferred stock and convertible notes payable (using the if-converted method). For purposes of all these calculations, potential common shares have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share of common stock as their effect is antidilutive since we generated a net loss in each period.
(4)	Pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock has been computed to give effect to the conversion of the convertible preferred stock into common stock. Also, the numerator in the pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share calculation has been adjusted to remove gains and losses resulting from remeasurements of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability as it is assumed that these warrants will be exercised immediately prior to a qualifying initial public offering and will no longer require periodic revaluation.

RISK FACTORS
Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this prospectus, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently believe are not material, also may become important factors that may adversely affect us and our prospects materially. If any of the following risks materialize, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. In such case, the price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.
Risks Related to Our Business and Industry
Our limited operating history makes evaluating our business and future prospects difficult, and may increase the risk of your investment.
You must consider the risks and difficulties we face as an early stage company with limited operating history. If we do not successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely harmed. We were formed in July 2003. We began delivering our first performance electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, in early 2008, and as of December 31, 2009 we had only sold 937 production vehicles to customers, almost all of which were sold in the United States and Europe. Our revenues were approximately $14.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and approximately $93.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. We have a very limited operating history on which investors can base an evaluation of our business, operating results and prospects. To date we have derived our revenues principally from sales of the Tesla Roadster and related sales of zero emission vehicle credits, and to a lesser extent on products and services related to electric powertrain sales. We intend in the longer term to derive substantial revenues from the sales of our planned Model S sedan electric vehicle which is at an early stage of development and which we do not expect to be in production until 2012. We have no operating history with respect to the Model S electric vehicle and have only recently begun the component procurement process for the Model S, which limits our ability to accurately forecast the cost of the vehicle. In addition, we have not yet completed the site selection process for the location of our manufacturing facility to produce such vehicles, finalized the design or completed our engineering, manufacturing or component supply plans for the Model S. In addition, to date our powertrain sales and powertrain research and development compensation have been exclusively generated under arrangements with Daimler AG, or Daimler, for the development and sale of a battery pack and a charger for Daimler’s Smart fortwo electric vehicle. Blackstar Investco LLC, or Blackstar, an affiliate of Daimler, holds more than 5% of our outstanding capital stock. Other than our arrangement with Daimler, we have not entered into a development or sales agreement for our electric powertrain business. There are no assurances that we will be able to secure future business with Daimler.
It is difficult to predict our future revenues and appropriately budget for our expenses, and we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business. In the event that actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust our estimates in future periods, our operating results and financial position could be materially affected.
In addition, our revenues to date have included amounts we receive from selling zero emission vehicle, or ZEV, credits to other automobile manufacturers, pursuant to certain state regulations. We have entered into an agreement with an automobile manufacturer for the sale of the ZEV credits that we earn from the sale of vehicles that we manufactured between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009, and we have until June 30, 2010 to sell these ZEV credits under the agreement. We are currently negotiating to extend this agreement for vehicles manufactured in 2010 and 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we had sold credits for 340 vehicles under this agreement and for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we recognized revenue from the sale of ZEV credits of $3.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively. We may not be
 
13
Table of Contents

able to enter into another agreement to sell these credits on equivalent terms and if this occurs, our financial results will be harmed.
We have a history of losses and we expect significant increases in our costs and expenses to result in continuing losses for at least the foreseeable future.
We incurred a net loss of approximately $31.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and have incurred net losses of approximately $236.4 million from our inception through September 30, 2009. We have had net losses in each quarter since our inception. We believe that we will continue to incur operating and net losses until at least the time we begin significant deliveries of the Model S, which is not expected to occur until 2012, or possibly later. Even if we are able to successfully develop the Model S, there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful. If we are to ever achieve profitability it will be dependent upon the successful development and successful commercial introduction and acceptance of automobiles such as the Model S, which may not occur.
We expect the rate at which we will incur losses to increase significantly in future periods from current levels as we:
 
 	•	 	
design, develop and manufacture our planned Model S;

 
 	•	 	
design, develop and manufacture components of our electric powertrain;

 
 	•	 	
develop and equip manufacturing facilities to produce our Model S;

 
 	•	 	
build up inventories of parts and components for our Model S;

 
 	•	 	
develop and equip manufacturing facilities to produce our electric powertrain components;

 
 	•	 	
open new Tesla stores;

 
 	•	 	
expand our design, development, maintenance and repair capabilities;

 
 	•	 	
increase our sales and marketing activities; and

 
 	•	 	
increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations.

Because we will incur the costs and expenses from these efforts before we receive any incremental revenues with respect thereto, our losses in future periods will be significantly greater than the losses we would incur if we developed our business more slowly. In addition, we may find that these efforts are more expensive than we currently anticipate or that these efforts may not result in increases in our revenues, which would further increase our losses.
In addition, as of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our United States net deferred tax assets as at this point we believe it is more likely than not that we will not achieve profitability and accordingly be able to use our deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future. In addition, we have not yet determined whether this offering would constitute an ownership change resulting in limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. If an ownership change is deemed to have occurred as a result of this offering, utilization of these assets could be significantly reduced.
Our future growth is dependent upon consumers’ willingness to adopt electric vehicles.
Our growth is highly dependent upon the adoption by consumers of, and we are subject to an elevated risk of any reduced demand for, alternative fuel vehicles, generally, and electric vehicles in particular. If consumers do not adopt electric vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be harmed. The market for alternative fuel vehicles is relatively new, rapidly evolving, characterized by rapidly changing technologies, price competition, additional competitors, evolving government regulation and industry standards,
 
14
Table of Contents

frequent new vehicle announcements and changing consumer demands and behaviors. Factors that may influence the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and specifically electric vehicles, include:
 
 	•	 	
perceptions about electric vehicle quality, safety (in particular with respect to lithium-ion battery packs), design, performance and cost, especially if adverse events or accidents occur that are linked to the quality or safety of electric vehicles;

 
 	•	 	
the limited range over which electric vehicles may be driven on a single battery charge;

 
 	•	 	
the decline of an electric vehicle’s range resulting from deterioration over time in the battery’s ability to hold a charge;

 
 	•	 	
concerns about electric grid capacity and reliability, which could derail our past and present efforts to promote electric vehicles as a practical solution to vehicles which require gasoline;

 
 	•	 	
the availability of alternative fuel vehicles, including plug-in hybrid electric vehicles;

 
 	•	 	
improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine;

 
 	•	 	
the availability of service for electric vehicles;

 
 	•	 	
consumers’ desire and ability to purchase a luxury automobile or one that is perceived as exclusive;

 
 	•	 	
the environmental consciousness of consumers;

 
 	•	 	
volatility in the cost of oil and gasoline;

 
 	•	 	
consumers’ perceptions of the dependency of the United States on oil from unstable or hostile countries, and government regulations and economic incentives promoting fuel efficiency and alternate forms of energy;

 
 	•	 	
access to charging stations, standardization of electric vehicle charging systems and consumers’ perceptions about convenience and cost to charge an electric vehicle;

 
 	•	 	
the availability of tax and other governmental incentives to purchase and operate electric vehicles or future regulation requiring increased use of nonpolluting vehicles;

 
 	•	 	
perceptions about and the actual cost of alternative fuel; and

 
 	•	 	
macroeconomic factors.

In addition, recent reports have suggested the potential for extreme temperatures to affect the range or performance of electric vehicles. For example, certain recent reports have suggested that electric vehicles operated in colder temperatures may experience a reduced overall range as batteries may lose the ability to hold a charge more rapidly in cold weather. If such reports gain widespread acceptance, our ability to market and sell our vehicles may be adversely impacted.
Additionally, we may become subject to regulations that may require us to alter the design of our vehicles, which could negatively impact consumer interest in our vehicles. For example, our electric vehicles make less noise than internal combustion vehicles. We are aware of advocacy groups, such as U.S. National Federation of the Blind, which are lobbying for regulations to require electric vehicle manufacturers to adopt minimum sound standards. We believe the relative quiet of our vehicles is one of its appealing aspects and any requirement to change this aspect may negatively affect consumer interest in our vehicles.
The influence of any of the factors described above may cause current or potential customers not to purchase our electric vehicles, which would seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects.

Table of Contents

The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines over time which may negatively influence potential customers’ decisions whether to purchase our vehicles.
The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time, and charging patterns. For example, a customer’s use of their Tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery’s ability to hold a charge. We currently expect that our battery pack will retain approximately 60-65% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or 7 years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle’s initial range. Such battery deterioration and the related decrease in range may negatively influence potential customer decisions whether to purchase our vehicles, which may harm our ability to market and sell our vehicles.
The operation of our vehicles is different from internal combustion engine vehicles and may be unfamiliar to customers.
We have designed our vehicles to minimize inconvenience and inadvertent driver damage to the powertrain. In certain instances, these protections may cause the vehicle to behave in ways that are unfamiliar to drivers of internal combustion vehicles. For example, we employ regenerative braking to recharge the battery in most modes of vehicle operation. Our customers may become accustomed to using this regenerative braking instead of the wheel brakes to slow the vehicle. However, when the vehicle is at maximum charge, the regenerative braking is not needed and is not employed. Accordingly, our customers may have difficulty shifting between different methods of braking. In addition, we use safety mechanisms to limit motor torque when the powertrain system reaches elevated temperatures. In such instances, the vehicle’s acceleration and speed will decrease. Finally, if the driver permits the battery to substantially deplete its charge, the vehicle will progressively limit motor torque and speed to preserve the charge that remains. The vehicle will lose speed and ultimately coast to a stop. Despite several warnings about an imminent loss of charge, the ultimate loss of speed may be unexpected. There can be no assurance that our customers will operate the vehicles properly, especially in these situations. Any accidents resulting from such failure to operate our vehicles properly could harm our brand and reputation, result in adverse publicity and product liability claims, and have a negative affect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. In addition, if consumers dislike these features, they may choose not to buy additional cars from us which could also harm our business.
Developments in alternative technologies or improvements in the internal combustion engine may materially adversely affect the demand for our electric vehicles.
Significant developments in alternative technologies, such as advanced diesel, ethanol, fuel cells or compressed natural gas, or improvements in the fuel economy of the internal combustion engine, may materially and adversely affect our business and prospects in ways we cannot anticipate. Any failure by us to develop new or enhanced technologies or processes, or to react to changes in existing technologies, could materially delay our development and introduction of new and enhanced electric vehicles, which could result in the loss of competitiveness of our vehicles, decreased revenue and a loss of market share to competitors.
If we are unable to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology, we may suffer a decline in our competitive position.
We may be unable to keep up with changes in electric vehicle technology and, as a result, may suffer a decline in our competitive position. Any failure to keep up with advances in electric vehicle technology would result in a decline in our competitive position which would materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. Our research and development efforts may not be sufficient to adapt to changes in, or create the necessary technology, independently. As technologies change, we plan to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology, in particular battery cell technology. However, our vehicles may not compete effectively with alternative vehicles if we are not able to source and integrate the latest technology into our vehicles. For example, we do not manufacture battery cells which makes us dependent upon other suppliers of battery cell technology for our battery packs.

We are dependent upon our ability to fully draw down on our loan facility from the United States Department of Energy, which may restrict our ability to conduct our business.
Our plan for manufacturing the Model S and for developing our electric powertrain facility depends on our ability to fully draw down on our loan facility from the United States Department of Energy, or the DOE, under the DOE’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program, or ATVM Program. We have entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing Bank, or the FFB, that is guaranteed by the DOE and which we refer to as the DOE Loan Facility. Our DOE Loan Facility provides for a $465.0 million loan facility under the DOE’s ATVM Program to help finance the continued development of the Model S, including the planned build out and operation of a manufacturing facility, and to finance the planned build out and operation of our electric powertrain manufacturing facility. We cannot, however, access all of these funds at once, but only over a period of up to three years through periodic draws as eligible costs are incurred. Our ability to draw down these funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions. For the Model S manufacturing facility project, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the Model S and the planned Model S manufacturing facility, including an environmental assessment of such facility approved by the DOE and the completion of the National Environmental Policy Act process. For the electric powertrain manufacturing facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain manufacturing facility and the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. Additionally, the DOE Loan Facility will require us to comply with certain operating covenants and will place additional restrictions on our ability to operate our business. We are unaccustomed to managing our business with such restrictions and others that are associated with a significant credit agreement. If we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the DOE Loan Facility, or our ability to make such draw downs is delayed, we may need to obtain additional or alternative financing to operate our Model S and electric powertrain manufacturing facilities to the extent our cash on hand is insufficient. Any failure to obtain the DOE funds or secure other alternative funding could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects. Such additional or alternative financing may not be available on attractive terms, if at all, and could be more costly for us to obtain. As a result, our plans for building our Model S and electric powertrain manufacturing plants could be significantly delayed which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Our DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among others, a requirement that the project be conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the ATVM Program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, prepay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business, and enter into certain restrictive agreements. These restrictions may limit our ability to operate our business and may cause us to take actions or prevent us from taking actions we believe are necessary from a competitive standpoint or that we otherwise believe are necessary to grow our business.
Our distribution model is different from the predominant current distribution model for automobile manufacturers, which makes evaluating our business, operating results and future prospects difficult.
Our distribution model is not common in the automobile industry today, particularly in the United States. We plan to continue to sell our performance electric vehicles over the internet and in company-owned Tesla stores. This model of vehicle distribution is relatively new and unproven, especially in the United States, and subjects us to substantial risk as it requires, in the aggregate, a significant expenditure and provides for slower expansion of our distribution and sales systems than may be possible by utilizing a more traditional dealer franchise system. For example, we will not be able to utilize long established sales channels developed through a franchise system to increase our sales volume, which may harm our business, prospects, financials condition and operating results. Moreover, we will be competing with companies with well established distribution channels.

As of December 31, 2009, we had opened 10 Tesla owned stores in the United States and Europe, 8 of which have been open for less than one year. We have only limited experience distributing and selling our performance vehicles through our Tesla stores. As of December 31, 2009 we had only sold 937 Tesla Roadsters to customers, primarily in the United States and Europe. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to effectively develop our own sales channels and marketing strategies. Implementing our business model is subject to numerous significant challenges, including obtaining permits and approvals from local and state authorities, and we may not be successful in addressing these challenges.
You must consider our business and prospects in light of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties we encounter as we implement our business model. For instance, we will need to persuade customers, suppliers and regulators of the validity and sustainability of our business model. We cannot be certain that we will be able to do so, or to successfully address the risks, uncertainties and difficulties that our business strategy faces. Any failure to successfully address any of the risks, uncertainties and difficulties related to our business model would have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.
We may face regulatory limitations on our ability to sell vehicles directly or over the internet which could materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our electric vehicles.
We sell our vehicles from our Tesla stores as well as over the internet. We may not be able to sell our vehicles through this sales model in each state in the United States as many states have laws that may be interpreted to prohibit internet sales by manufacturers to residents of the state or to impose other limitations on this sales model, including laws that prohibit manufacturers from selling vehicles directly to consumers without the use of an independent dealership or without a physical presence in the state. For example, the state of Texas prohibits a manufacturer from being licensed as a dealer or to act in the capacity of a dealer, which would prohibit us from operating a store in the state of Texas and may restrict our ability to sell vehicles to Texas residents over the internet from out of state altogether without altering our sales model. The state of Kansas provides that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a Kansas resident except through a dealer licensed to do business in the state of Kansas, which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of Kansas in order to sell vehicles to Kansas residents. In some states where we have opened a “gallery,” which is a location where potential customers can view our vehicles but is not a full retail location, it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturer-dealer laws. For example, the state of Colorado required us to obtain dealer and manufacturer licenses in the state in order to operate our gallery in Colorado. In addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities.
The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely untested under state motor vehicle industry laws, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, the manner in which the applicable authorities will apply their state laws to our distribution model is unknown. Such laws, as well as other laws governing the motor vehicle industry, may subject us to potential inquiries and investigations from state motor vehicle regulators who may question whether our sales model complies with applicable state motor vehicle industry laws and who may require us to change our sales model or may prohibit our ability to sell our vehicles to residents in such states.

To date, we are registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois and Washington and we are licensed as a motor vehicle dealer in the state of New York. We have not yet sought formal clarification of our ability to sell our vehicles in any other states.
Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time.
We are almost entirely dependent upon revenue generated from the sale of our electric vehicles, specifically the Tesla Roadster, in the near term, and our future success will be dependent upon our ability to design and achieve market acceptance of new vehicle models, and specifically the Model S.
We currently generate substantially all of our revenue from the sale of our Tesla Roadsters and the sale of the related zero emission vehicle credits. We began production of our Tesla Roadster only in 2008, and our second planned vehicle, our Model S, is not expected to be in production until 2012, requires significant investment prior to commercial introduction, and may never be successfully developed or commercially successful. There can be no assurance that we will be able to design future models of performance electric vehicles that will meet the expectations of our customers or that our future models, including the Model S, will become commercially viable. In particular, it is common in the automotive industry for the production vehicle to have a styling and design different from that of the concept vehicle, which may happen with the Model S. We believe the design of the early prototype Model S is one of the key reasons why we have received approximately 2,000 reservations for the vehicle as of December 31, 2009. To the extent that we are not able to build the production Model S to the expectations created by the early prototype, customers may cancel their reservations and our future sales could be harmed. Additionally, historically, automobile customers have come to expect new and improved vehicle models to be introduced frequently. In order to meet these expectations, we may in the future be required to introduce on a regular basis new vehicle models as well as enhanced versions of existing vehicle models. As technologies change in the future for automobiles in general and performance electric vehicles specifically, we will be expected to upgrade or adapt our vehicles and introduce new models in order to continue to provide vehicles with the latest technology. To date we have limited experience simultaneously designing, testing, manufacturing and selling our electric vehicles.
We anticipate that we will experience a decrease in revenues and increase in losses prior to the launch of the Model S.
Prior to the launch of our Model S, we anticipate our automotive sales may decline, potentially significantly as we do not plan to sell our current generation Tesla Roadster after 2011 due to planned tooling changes at a supplier for the Tesla Roadster, and we do not currently plan to begin selling our next generation Tesla Roadster until at least one year after the launch of the Model S, which is not expected to be in production until 2012. Furthermore, except for our arrangements with Daimler, we do not currently have any significant arrangements in place with third parties for the development or purchase of components in our electric powertrain business. There are no assurances that we will be able to secure future business with Daimler as it has indicated its intent to produce all of its lithium-ion batteries by 2012 as part of a joint venture with Evonik Industries AG. As a result, we anticipate that we will generate limited, if any, revenue from selling electric vehicles after 2011 until the launch of our Model S. The launch of our Model S could be delayed for a number of reasons and any such delays may be significant and would extend the period in which we would generate limited, if any, revenues from sales of our electric vehicles. The expected decrease in revenues for the periods prior to the launch of the Model S may be significant and could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition and our ability to fund operating losses could seriously constrain our growth.

A large amount of our Tesla Roadster sales revenue in 2009 was due to the fulfillment of orders from reservations taken in prior years.
As of December 31, 2009 we had sold 937 Tesla Roadsters to customers, almost all of which were sold in the United States and Europe, of which a large number were reserved by customers in prior years. Of these Tesla Roadsters, we delivered and recognized revenue on 324 in the quarter ended September 30, 2009 as we made a significant effort to increase our production capacity in order to accelerate deliveries to customers. As a result, our revenues in the quarter ended September 30, 2009 were significantly higher than in prior quarters. Additionally, to date many of our Tesla Roadster sales have been made to persons who had pre-existing relationships with our management team or who are affluent individuals with a strong interest in owning a novel product. It may be difficult to attract high numbers of new Tesla Roadster customers who do not have pre-existing relationships with us or who are attracted to buy the Tesla Roadster after its initial novelty phase. We may not have a significant wait list of orders for our Tesla Roadster in the future, and we may not be able to maintain or increase our vehicle sales revenue in future quarters. This may be the case even though we will make significant investments to expand our network of Tesla stores and sales personnel. Furthermore, potential customers may decide to defer purchasing the Tesla Roadster in anticipation of our planned next generation Tesla Roadster or Model S.
We have received only a limited number of current reservations for Tesla Roadsters and Model S sedans, all of which are subject to cancellation.
As of December 31, 2009, we had unfilled reservations for approximately 220 Tesla Roadsters and approximately 2,000 Model S sedans, all of which are subject to cancellation by the customer up until delivery of the vehicle. All of our reservations are refundable, subject to a cancellation fee and we have had a significant number of customers who submitted reservations for the Tesla Roadster or the Model S cancel those reservations. Our customers have historically cancelled, and may cancel, their reservations for many reasons, including the customer’s inability to fund the purchase, the customer’s decision to forego the purchase during the economic downturn, the customer’s lack of confidence in our long-term viability and our ability to deliver the promised vehicle, the customer’s concern over the ultimate price of the vehicle, including the price of its options, or the potentially long wait from the time a reservation is made until the time the vehicle is delivered. In addition, given the long lead times that we have historically experienced between customer reservation and delivery on the Tesla Roadster and that we expect to experience on the Model S, there is a heightened risk that customers that have made reservations may not ultimately take delivery on vehicles due to potential changes in customer preferences, competitive developments and other factors. For example, when we delayed the introduction of the original Tesla Roadster in fall 2007, we experienced a significant number of customers that cancelled their reservations and requested the return of their reservation payment. If we encounter delays in the introduction of the Model S, we believe that a significant number of our customers could cancel their reservations. As a result, no assurance can be made that reservations will not be cancelled and will ultimately result in the final purchase, delivery, and sale of the vehicle. Such cancellations could harm our financial condition, business, prospects and operating results.
If we are unable to design, develop, market and sell new electric vehicles and services that address additional market opportunities, our business, prospects and operating results will suffer.
We may not be able to successfully develop new electric vehicles and services, address new market segments or develop a significantly broader customer base. To date, we have focused our business on the sale of high-performance electric vehicles and have targeted relatively affluent consumers. We will need to address additional markets and expand our customer demographic in order to further grow our business. In particular, we intend the Model S to appeal to the customers of premium sedans, which is a much larger and different demographic from that of the Tesla Roadster. Successfully offering a vehicle in this vehicle class requires delivering a vehicle with a higher standard of fit and finish in the interior and exterior than currently exists in the Tesla Roadster, at a price that is competitive with other premium sedans. We have not completed the design, component sourcing or manufacturing process for the Model S, so it is difficult to forecast its eventual cost,

manufacturability or quality. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to deliver a vehicle that is ultimately competitive in the premium sedan class. Our failure to address additional market opportunities would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.
Our production model for the non-powertrain portion of the Model S is unproven, still evolving and is very different from the non-powertrain portion of the production model for the Tesla Roadster.
Our future business depends in large part on our ability to execute on our plans to develop, manufacture, market and sell our planned Model S electric vehicle. To date our revenues have been principally derived from the sales of our Tesla Roadster. The Tesla Roadster has only been produced in low volume quantities and the body is assembled by Lotus Cars Limited, or Lotus, in the United Kingdom, with the final assembly by us at our facility in Menlo Park, California for sales destined in the United States. We plan to manufacture the Model S in higher volumes than our present production capabilities in our planned manufacturing facility. As a result, the non-powertrain portion of the production model for the Model S will be substantially different and significantly more complex than the non-powertrain portion of the production model for the Tesla Roadster. In addition, we plan to introduce a number of new manufacturing technologies and techniques, such as a new painting process and aluminum spot welding systems, which have not been widely adopted in the automotive industry. Our Model S production model will require significant investments of cash and management resources and we may experience unexpected delays or difficulties that could postpone our ability to launch or achieve full manufacturing capacity for the Model S, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.
Our production model for the Model S is based on many key assumptions, which may turn out to be incorrect, including:
 
 	•	 	
that we will be able to identify and secure an appropriate facility for the manufacturing of our Model S;

 
 	•	 	
that we will be able to secure the funding necessary to build out and equip the manufacturing facilities in a timely manner, including meeting milestones and other conditions necessary to draw down funds under our loan facility with the DOE;

 
 	•	 	
that we will able to develop and equip the manufacturing facilities for the Model S without exceeding our projected costs and on our projected timeline;

 
 	•	 	
that the equipment we select will be able to accurately manufacture the vehicle within specified design tolerances;

 
 	•	 	
that our computer aided design process can reduce the product development time by accurately predicting the performance of our vehicle for passing relevant safety standards, including standards that can only be met through expensive crash testing;

 
 	•	 	
that we will be able to obtain the necessary permits and approvals, including those under the California Environmental Quality Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, as well as building and air quality permits, to comply with local zoning, environmental and similar regulations to operate our manufacturing facilities and our business on our projected timeline;

 
 	•	 	
that we will be able to engage suppliers for the necessary components on terms and conditions acceptable to us and that we will be able to obtain components on a timely basis and in the necessary quantities;

 
 	•	 	
that we will be able to deliver final component designs to our suppliers in a timely manner;

 
 	•	 	
that we will be able to attract, recruit, hire and train skilled employees, including employees on the production line, to operate our Model S manufacturing facility;

 
 	•	 	
that we will be able to maintain high quality controls as we transition to an in-house manufacturing process; and

 
 	•	 	
that we will not experience any significant delays or disruptions in our supply chain.

If one or more of the foregoing assumptions turns out to be incorrect, our ability to successfully launch the Model S on time and on budget if at all, and our business prospects, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely impacted.
We have no experience to date in high volume manufacturing of our electric vehicles. We do not know whether we will be able to develop efficient, automated, low-cost manufacturing capability and processes, and reliable sources of component supply, that will enable us to meet the quality, price, engineering, design and production standards, as well as the production volumes required to successfully mass market the Model S. Even if we are successful in developing our high volume manufacturing capability and processes and reliable sources of component supply, we do not know whether we will be able to do so in a manner that avoids significant delays and cost overruns, including as a result of factors beyond our control such as problems with suppliers and vendors, or in time to meet our vehicle commercialization schedules or to satisfy the requirements of customers. Any failure to develop such manufacturing processes and capabilities within our projected costs and timelines could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.
We may experience significant delays in the design, manufacture, launch and financing of the Model S which could harm our business and prospects.
Any delay in the financing, design, manufacture and launch of the Model S could materially damage our brand, business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Automobile manufacturers often experience delays in the design, manufacture and commercial release of new vehicle models. We experienced significant delays in launching the Tesla Roadster. We initially announced that we would begin delivering the Tesla Roadster in June 2007, but due to various design and production delays, we did not physically deliver our first Tesla Roadster until February 2008, and we only achieved higher production of this vehicle in the quarter ended December 31, 2008. These delays resulted in additional costs and adverse publicity for our business. We may experience similar delays in launching the Model S, and any such delays could be significant.
We have not selected a facility in which to manufacture and assemble our Model S although we intend to begin production of the Model S in 2012. In addition, final designs for the Model S and the site selection and plans for the build out of the planned manufacturing facility are still in process, and various aspects of the Model S component procurement and manufacturing plans have not yet been determined. We are currently evaluating, qualifying and selecting our suppliers for the planned production of the Model S. However, we may not be able to engage suppliers for the remaining components in a timely manner, at an acceptable price or in the necessary quantities. In addition, we will also need to do extensive testing to ensure that the Model S is in compliance with applicable NHTSA safety regulations and EPA regulations prior to beginning mass production and delivery of the vehicles. Our plan to begin production of the Model S by 2012 is dependent upon the timely availability of funds, upon our finalizing the related design, engineering, component procurement, testing, build out, and manufacturing plans in a timely manner and upon our ability to execute these plans within the current timeline.
We intend to fund the build out of this manufacturing facility using existing cash, cash from this offering and cash obtained through the DOE Loan Facility. Our ability to draw down these funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions. These draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the Model S and the planned Model S manufacturing facility, including completion of an environmental assessment of such facility approved by the DOE and the completion of the National Environmental Policy Act process. If we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the DOE Loan Facility on the timeline that we anticipate, our plans for building our Model S and electric powertrain manufacturing plants could be significantly delayed which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We face significant barriers in our attempt to produce our Model S, and if we cannot successfully overcome those barriers our business will be negatively impacted.
We face significant barriers as we attempt to produce our first mass produced vehicle, our Model S. We currently have a drivable early prototype of the Model S, but do not have a full production intent prototype, a

final design, a manufacturing facility or a manufacturing process. The automobile industry has traditionally been characterized by significant barriers to entry, including large capital requirements, investment costs of designing and manufacturing vehicles, long lead times to bring vehicles to market from the concept and design stage, the need for specialized design and development expertise, regulatory requirements and establishing a brand name and image and the need to establish sales and service locations. As a manufacturer and seller of only electric vehicles, we face a variety of added challenges to entry that a traditional automobile manufacturer would not encounter including additional costs of developing and producing an electric powertrain that has comparable performance to a traditional gasoline engine in terms of range and power, inexperience with servicing electric vehicles, regulations associated with the transport of lithium-ion batteries and unproven high-volume customer demand for fully electric vehicles. In addition, while we are designing the Model S to have the capability to swap out its battery pack, there are no specialized facilities today to perform such swapping. While we may offer this service in the future at our stores, no assurance can be provided that we will do so, or that any other third party will offer such services. We must successfully overcome these barriers as we move from producing the low volume Tesla Roadster to the Model S which we plan to produce at much higher volumes. If we are not able to overcome these barriers, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition will be negatively impacted and our ability to grow our business will be harmed.
Any changes to the Federal Trade Commission’s electric vehicle range testing procedure or the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s energy consumption regulations for electric vehicles could result in a reduction to the advertised range of our vehicles which could negatively impact our sales and harm our business.
The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requires us to calculate and display the range of our electric vehicles on a label we affix to the vehicle’s window. The FTC specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers, or SAE, which further requires that we test using the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s, or EPA’s, combined city and highway testing cycles. The EPA recently announced that it would develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles. Based on initial indications from the EPA, we believe it is likely that the EPA will modify its testing cycles in a manner that, when applied to our vehicles, could reduce the advertised range of our vehicles by up to 30% as compared to the combined two-cycle test currently applicable to our vehicles. However, there can be no assurance that the modified EPA testing cycles will not result in a greater reduction. To the extent that the FTC adopts these procedures in place of the current procedures from the SAE, this could impair our ability to advertise the Tesla Roadster as a vehicle that is capable of going in excess of 200 miles. Moreover, such changes could impair our ability to deliver the Model S with the initially advertised range, which could result in the cancellation of a number of the approximately 2,000 reservations that have been placed for the Model S. Although the real life customer experience of the range of our electric vehicles will not change due to the changes in the FTC or EPA standards, the reduction in the advertised range could negatively impact our sales and harm our business.
We have no experience with using common platforms in the design and manufacture of our vehicles.
If we are unable to effectively leverage the benefits of using an adaptable platform architecture, our business prospects, operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We intend to design the Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of the Model S to create future electric vehicles. We have no experience with using common platforms in the design and manufacture of our vehicles and the design of the Model S is not complete. We may make changes to the design of the Model S that may make it more difficult to use the Model S platform for future vehicles. There are no assurances that we will be able to use the Model S platform to bring future vehicle models to market faster or more inexpensively by leveraging use of this common platform or that there will be sufficient customer demand for additional vehicle variants of this platform.

If we are unable to reduce and adequately control the costs associated with operating our business, including our costs of manufacturing, sales and materials, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects will suffer.
If we are unable to reduce and/or maintain a sufficiently low level of costs for designing, manufacturing, marketing, selling and distributing and servicing our electric vehicles relative to their selling prices, our operating results, gross margins, business and prospects could be materially and adversely impacted. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant investments for the design, manufacture and sales of our electric vehicles. When we first began delivering our Tesla Roadster in early 2008, our marginal costs of producing the Tesla Roadster exceeded our revenue from selling those vehicles. Revenue from the sales of our Tesla Roadster as well as from zero emission vehicle, or ZEV, credits did not exceed costs of sales related to our Tesla Roadster, until the nine months ended September 30, 2009. There can be no assurances that our costs of producing and delivering the Model S will be less than the revenue we generate from sales at the time of the Model S launch or that we will ever achieve a positive gross margin on sales of the Model S.
We incur significant costs related to procuring the raw materials required to manufacture our high-performance electric cars, assembling vehicles and compensating our personnel. We will also incur substantial costs in constructing and building out our Model S and powertrain manufacturing facilities, each of which could potentially face cost overruns or delays in construction. Additionally, in the future we may be required to incur substantial marketing costs and expenses to promote our vehicles, including through the use of traditional media such as television, radio and print, even though our marketing expenses to date have been relatively limited. If we are unable to keep our operating costs aligned with the level of revenues we generate, our operating results, business and prospects will be harmed. Many of the factors that impact our operating costs are beyond our control. For example, the costs of our raw materials and components, such as lithium-ion battery cells or carbon fiber body panels used in our vehicles, could increase due to shortages as global demand for these products increases. Indeed, if the popularity of electric vehicles exceeds current expectations without significant expansion in battery cell production capacity and advancements in battery cell technology, shortages could occur which would result in increased materials costs to us.
The automotive market is highly competitive, and we may not be successful in competing in this industry. We currently face competition from established competitors and expect to face competition from others in the future.
The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. As of December 31, 2009, no other mass produced performance highway capable electric vehicles were being sold in the United States or Europe. However, we expect competitors to enter these markets within the next several years with some entering as early as the end of 2010 and as they do so we expect that we will experience significant competition. With respect to our Tesla Roadster, we currently face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers, including manufacturers of high-performance vehicles, such as Porsche and Ferrari. In addition, upon the launch of our Model S sedan, we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive luxury sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes.
Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. For example, Nissan has announced that it is developing the Nissan Leaf, a fully electric vehicle, which it plans to bring to market in late 2010. BYD Auto has also announced plans to bring an electric vehicle into the United States market in 2010, and Ford has announced that it plans to introduce an electric vehicle in 2011. In addition, General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, General Motors has announced that it is developing the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery. General Motors announced that it plans to begin selling the Chevrolet Volt in 2010.

Moreover, it has been reported that Daimler, Lexus, Audi, Renault, Mitsubishi and Subaru are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles, although none of these have yet come to market. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well.
Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively.
Furthermore, certain large manufacturers offer financing and leasing options on their vehicles and also have the ability to market vehicles at a substantial discount, provided that the vehicles are financed through their affiliated financing company. We do not currently offer discounts or leasing options on our vehicles, which may put our vehicles at a competitive disadvantage. While we have recently arranged for financing options on our vehicles in the United States through a third-party lender, we do not provide direct financing for the purchase of the Tesla Roadster to our customers, unlike most of our competitors.
We expect competition in our industry to intensify in the future in light of increased demand for alternative fuel vehicles, continuing globalization and consolidation in the worldwide automotive industry. Factors affecting competition include product quality and features, innovation and development time, pricing, reliability, safety, fuel economy, customer service and financing terms. Increased competition may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in a further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Our ability to successfully compete in our industry will be fundamental to our future success in existing and new markets and our market share. There can be no assurances that we will be able to compete successfully in our markets. If our competitors introduce new cars or services that compete with or surpass the quality, price or performance of our cars or services, we may be unable to satisfy existing customers or attract new customers at the prices and levels that would allow us to generate attractive rates of return on our investment. Increased competition could result in price reductions and revenue shortfalls, loss of customers and loss of market share, which could harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Demand in the automobile industry is highly volatile.
Volatility of demand in the automobile industry may materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The markets in which we currently compete and plan to compete in the future have been subject to considerable volatility in demand in recent periods. For example, according to automotive industry sources, sales of passenger vehicles in North America during the quarter ended December 31, 2008 were over 30% lower than those during the same period in the prior year. Demand for automobile sales depends to a large extent on general, economic, political and social conditions in a given market and the introduction of new vehicles and technologies. As a new automobile manufacturer and low volume producer, we have less financial resources than more established automobile manufacturers to withstand changes in the market and disruptions in demand. As our business grows, economic conditions and trends in other countries and regions where we sell our electric vehicles will impact our business, prospects and operating results as well. Demand for our electric vehicles may also be affected by factors directly impacting automobile price or the cost of purchasing and operating automobiles such as sales and financing incentives, prices of raw materials and parts and components, cost of fuel and governmental regulations, including tariffs, import regulation and other taxes. Volatility in demand may lead to lower vehicle unit sales and increased inventory, which may result in further downward price pressure and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and

operating results. These effects may have a more pronounced impact on our business given our relatively smaller scale and financial resources as compared to many incumbent automobile manufacturers.
Difficult economic conditions may affect consumer purchases of luxury items, such as our performance electric vehicles.
Over the last 18 months, the deterioration in the global financial markets and continually challenging condition of the macroeconomic environment has negatively impacted consumer spending and we believe has adversely affected the sales of our Tesla Roadster. The automobile industry in particular was severely impacted by the poor economic conditions and several vehicle manufacturing companies, including General Motors and Chrysler, were forced to file for bankruptcy. Sales of new automobiles generally have dropped during this recessionary period. Sales of high-end and luxury consumer products, such as our performance electric vehicles, depend in part on discretionary consumer spending and are even more exposed to adverse changes in general economic conditions. Discretionary consumer spending also is affected by other factors, including changes in tax rates and tax credits, interest rates and the availability and terms of consumer credit.
If the current difficult economic conditions continue or worsen, we may experience a decline in the demand for our Tesla Roadster or reservations for our Model S, either of which could harm our business, prospects and operating results. Accordingly, any events that have a negative effect on the United States economy or on foreign economies or that negatively affect consumer confidence in the economy, including disruptions in credit and stock markets, and actual or perceived economic slowdowns, may harm our business, prospects and operating results.
Our financial results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to the seasonality of our business and fluctuations in our operating costs.
Our operating results may vary significantly from period-to-period due to many factors, including seasonal factors that may have an effect on the demand for our electric vehicles. Demand for new cars in the automobile industry in general, and for high-performance sports vehicles such as the Tesla Roadster in particular, typically decline over the winter season, while sales are generally higher as compared to the winter season during the spring and summer months. We expect sales of the Tesla Roadster to fluctuate on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters. We note that, in general, automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of the Model S and other models we introduce may have similar seasonality. However, our limited operations history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. Also, any unusually severe weather conditions in some markets may impact demand for our vehicles. Our operating results could also suffer if we do not achieve revenue consistent with our expectations for this seasonal demand because many of our expenses are based on anticipated levels of annual revenue.
We also expect our period-to-period operating results to vary based on our operating costs which we anticipate will increase significantly in future periods as we, among other things, design, develop and manufacture our planned Model S and electric powertrain components, build and equip new manufacturing facilities to produce the Model S and electric powertrain components, open new Tesla stores with maintenance and repair capabilities, incur costs for warranty repairs or product recalls, if any, increase our sales and marketing activities, and increase our general and administrative functions to support our growing operations.
As a result of these factors, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that these comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance. Moreover, our operating results may not meet expectations of equity research analysts or investors. If this occurs, the trading price of our common stock could fall substantially either suddenly or over time.

Marketplace confidence in our liquidity and long-term business prospects is important for building and maintaining our business.
If we are unable to establish and maintain confidence about our liquidity and business prospects among consumers and within our industry, then our financial condition, operating results and business prospects may suffer. Our vehicles are highly technical products that require maintenance and support. If we were to cease or cut back operations, even years from now, buyers of our vehicles from years earlier might have much more difficulty in maintaining their vehicles and obtaining satisfactory support. As a result, consumers may be less likely to purchase our vehicles now if they are not convinced that our business will succeed or that our operations will continue for many years. Similarly, suppliers and other third parties will be less likely to invest time and resources in developing business relationships with us if they are not convinced that our business will succeed. For example, during the economic downturn of 2008, we had difficulty raising the necessary funding for our operations, and, as a result, in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 we had to lay off approximately 60 employees and curtail our expansion plans. In addition, during this period a number of customers canceled their previously placed reservations. If we are required to take similar actions in the future, such actions may result in negative perceptions regarding our liquidity and long-term business prospects.
Accordingly, in order to build and maintain our business, we must maintain confidence among customers, suppliers and other parties in our liquidity and long-term business prospects. In contrast to some more established auto makers, we believe that, in our case, the task of maintaining such confidence may be particularly complicated by factors such as the following:
 
 	•	 	
our limited operating history;

 
 	•	 	
our limited revenues and lack of profitability to date;

 
 	•	 	
unfamiliarity with or uncertainty about the Tesla Roadster and the Model S;

 
 	•	 	
uncertainty about the long-term marketplace acceptance of alternative fuel vehicles, or electric vehicles specifically;

 
 	•	 	
the prospect that we will need ongoing infusions of external capital to fund our planned operations;

 
 	•	 	
the size of our expansion plans in comparison to our existing capital base and scope and history of operations; and

 
 	•	 	
the prospect or actual emergence of direct, sustained competitive pressure from more established auto makers, which may be more likely if our initial efforts are perceived to be commercially successful.

Many of these factors are largely outside our control, and any negative perceptions about our liquidity or long-term business prospects, even if exaggerated or unfounded, would likely harm our business and make it more difficult to raise additional funds when needed.
We may need to raise additional funds and these funds may not be available to us when we need them. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected.
The design, manufacture, sale and servicing of automobiles is a capital intensive business. Since inception through the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we have incurred net losses of approximately $236.4 million and have used approximately $173.8 million of cash in operations and while recognizing only approximately $108.2 million in revenue. As of September 30, 2009, we had $106.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. We expect that the proceeds of this offering and the DOE Loan Facility, together with our anticipated cash from operating activities and cash on hand, will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 24 months. However, if there are delays in the launch of the Model S, if we are unable to draw down the anticipated funds under the DOE Loan Facility, or if the costs in building our Model S and powertrain manufacturing facilities exceed our expectations or if we incur any significant unplanned expenses, we may need to raise additional funds through
 
27
Table of Contents

the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. This capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations, continue research, development and design efforts, expand our network of Tesla stores and services centers, improve infrastructure, and introduce new vehicles. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we cannot raise additional funds when we need them, our operations and prospects could be negatively affected. For example, during the economic downturn of 2008, we had difficulty raising the necessary funding for our operations and, as a result, in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 we had to lay off approximately 60 employees and curtail our expansion plans. Additionally, under our DOE Loan Facility, we face restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness, and in the future may need to obtain a waiver from the DOE in order to do so. We may not be able to obtain such waiver from the DOE which may harm our business. Future issuance of equity or equity-related securities will dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders and our issuance of debt securities could increase the risk or perceived risk of our company.
If our vehicles fail to perform as expected, our ability to develop, market and sell our electric vehicles could be harmed.
Our vehicles may contain defects in design and manufacture that may cause them not to perform as expected or that may require repair. For example, our vehicles use a substantial amount of software code to operate. Software products are inherently complex and often contain defects and errors when first introduced. While we have performed extensive internal testing, we currently have a very limited frame of reference by which to evaluate the performance of our Tesla Roadster in the hands of our customers and currently have no frame of reference by which to evaluate the performance of our Tesla Roadster after several years of customer driving. We have no frame of reference by which to evaluate our Model S upon which our business prospects depend. There can be no assurance that we will be able to detect and fix any defects in the vehicles prior to their sale to consumers. We previously experienced a product recall in May 2009 after we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster “glider,” which is the partially assembled Tesla Roadster that does not contain our electric powertrain. We may experience additional recalls in the future, which could adversely affect our brand in our target markets and could adversely affect our business, prospects and results of operations. Our electric vehicles, including the Tesla Roadster and Model S, may not perform consistent with customers’ expectations or consistent with other vehicles currently available. For example, our electric vehicles may not have the durability or longevity of current vehicles, and may not be as easy to repair as other vehicles currently on the market. Any product defects or any other failure of our performance electric vehicles to perform as expected could harm our reputation and result in adverse publicity, lost revenue, delivery delays, product recalls, product liability claims, harm to our brand and reputation, and significant warranty and other expenses, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.
We have very limited experience servicing our vehicles and we are using a different service model from the one typically used in the industry. If we are unable to address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business will be materially and adversely affected.
If we are unable to successfully address the service requirements of our existing and future customers our business and prospects will be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we anticipate the level and quality of the service we provide our Tesla Roadster customers will have a direct impact on the success of the Model S and our future vehicles. If we are unable to satisfactorily service our Tesla Roadsters customers, our ability to generate customer loyalty, grow our business and sell additional Tesla Roadsters as well as Model S sedans could be impaired.
We have very limited experience servicing our vehicles. As of December 31, 2009 we had sold only 937 Tesla Roadsters to customers, primarily in the United States and Europe. We do not plan to begin production of any Model S vehicles until 2012, and do not have any experience servicing these cars as they do not exist

currently. Servicing electric vehicles is different than servicing vehicles with internal combustion engines and requires specialized skills, including high voltage training and servicing techniques.
We plan to service our performance electric vehicles through our company-owned Tesla stores and through our mobile service technicians known as the Tesla Rangers. As of December 31, 2009, we had opened 10 Tesla owned stores that are equipped to actively service our performance electric vehicles, 8 of which have been open for less than one year, and to date we have only limited experience servicing our performance vehicles through our Tesla stores. We will need to open additional Tesla stores with service capabilities, as well as hire and train significant numbers of new employees to staff these centers and act as Tesla Rangers, in order to successfully maintain our fleet of delivered performance electric vehicles. We only implemented our Tesla Rangers program in October 2009 and have limited experience in deploying them to service our customers’ vehicles. There can be no assurance that these service arrangements or our limited experience servicing our vehicles will adequately address the service requirements of our customers to their satisfaction, or that we will have sufficient resources to meet these service requirement in a timely manner as the volume of vehicles we are able to deliver annually increases.
We do not expect to be able to open Tesla stores in all the geographic areas in which our existing and potential customers may reside. In order to address the service needs of customers that are not in geographical proximity to our service centers, we plan to either transport those vehicles to the nearest Tesla store for servicing or deploy our mobile Tesla Rangers to service the vehicles at the customer’s location. These special arrangements may be expensive and we may not be able to recoup the costs of providing these services to our customers. In addition, a number of potential customers may choose not to purchase our vehicles because of the lack of a more widespread service network. If we do not adequately address our customers’ service needs, our brand and reputation will be adversely affected, which in turn, could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.
Traditional automobile manufacturers do not provide maintenance and repair services directly. Consumers must rather service their vehicles through franchised dealerships or through third party maintenance service providers. We do not have any such arrangements with third party service providers and it is unclear when or even whether such third party service providers will be able to acquire the expertise to service our vehicles. At this point, we anticipate that we will be providing substantially all of the service for our vehicles for the foreseeable future. As our vehicles are placed in more locations, we may encounter negative reactions from our consumers who are frustrated that they cannot use local service stations to the same extent as they have with their conventional automobiles and this frustration may result in negative publicity and reduced sales, thereby harming our business and prospects.
In addition, the motor vehicle industry laws in many states require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles physically sold from locations in the state. Whether these laws would also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to consumers in a state in which we have no physical presence is uncertain. While we believe our Tesla Ranger program and our practice of shipping customers’ vehicles to our nearest Tesla store for service would satisfy regulators in these circumstances, without seeking formal regulatory guidance, there are no assurances that regulators will not attempt to require that we provide physical service facilities in their states. If issues arise in connection with these laws, certain aspects of Tesla’s service program would need to be restructured to comply with state law, which may harm our business.
We may not succeed in continuing to establish, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, which would materially and adversely affect customer acceptance of our vehicles and components and our business, revenues and prospects.
Our business and prospects are heavily dependent on our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand. Any failure to develop, maintain and strengthen our brand may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell the Tesla Roadster and planned electric vehicles, including the Model S, and sell our electric

powertrain components. If we do not continue to establish, maintain and strengthen our brand, we may lose the opportunity to build a critical mass of customers. Promoting and positioning our brand will likely depend significantly on our ability to provide high quality electric cars and maintenance and repair services, and we have very limited experience in these areas. In addition, we expect that our ability to develop, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand will also depend heavily on the success of our marketing efforts. To date, we have limited experience with marketing activities as we have relied primarily on the internet, word of mouth and attendance at industry trade shows to promote our brand. To further promote our brand, we may be required to change our marketing practices, which could result in substantially increased advertising expenses, including the need to use traditional media such as television, radio and print. The automobile industry is intensely competitive, and we may not be successful in building, maintaining and strengthening our brand. Many of our current and potential competitors, particularly automobile manufacturers headquartered in Detroit, Japan and the European Union, have greater name recognition, broader customer relationships and substantially greater marketing resources than we do. If we do not develop and maintain a strong brand, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely impacted.
We are in the process of transitioning our motor manufacturing and battery pack assembly process for the Tesla Roadster and any difficulties we encounter during this transition could materially and adversely affect our business.
We are in the process of transitioning our motor manufacturing and battery pack assembly processes for the Tesla Roadster and may experience unexpected delays or difficulties in executing this transition. We historically have used facilities in Taiwan to assemble the motors for the Tesla Roadster and facilities in San Carlos, California to assemble the battery pack for the Tesla Roadster. These operations are transitioning to our new facility in Palo Alto, California, and we believe our facility relocation will be complete in the first half of 2010. We may experience issues that disrupt the production of these components as we migrate our production processes to our Palo Alto facility. Additionally, our lease agreement for the Menlo Park facility where the powertrain is assembled in the glider of the Tesla Roadster permits the landlord to terminate the lease without cause with six months’ notice. Any such termination could require us to relocate our Menlo Park operations to another facility although we believe such relocation could be accomplished in a relatively short period of time. Any difficulties we encounter while we transition our manufacturing operations in-house could materially and adversely affect our ability to manufacture and deliver our Tesla Roadsters to customers.
We are dependent upon our relationship with Lotus for the manufacturing of the Tesla Roadster.
In July 2005, we entered into a supply agreement with Lotus pursuant to which Lotus agreed to assist with the design and manufacture of our Tesla Roadster. Although we complete the final assembly of our Tesla Roadster in our Menlo Park facility for vehicles destined for the United States market, currently we are dependent upon Lotus to complete the initial portion of the assembly process of the Tesla Roadster for us in Hethel, England and we expect to be so until we discontinue sales of our current generation Tesla Roadster. We currently do not intend to sell our current generation Tesla Roadster after 2011 to accommodate planned tooling changes. We anticipate that our next generation Tesla Roadster, which we only plan to launch after we begin production of the Model S, will be manufactured in our own facilities.
Pursuant to the supply agreement with Lotus, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 1,700 partially assembled or fully assembled vehicles over the three year term of the agreement, which will expire in March 2011. The partially assembled vehicles do not contain our electric powertrain and are referred to as “gliders.” If we are unable to meet this volume requirement, we are still responsible for payment to Lotus of the lesser of (i) the sum of Lotus’ actual incurred costs and an agreed upon profit margin per vehicle up to the minimum volume requirement or (ii) £5,400,000. As of December 31, 2009, we had purchased approximately 1,000 vehicles or gliders under this agreement. We do not currently have a supply agreement with Lotus for the supply of Tesla Roadster vehicles or gliders beyond the 1,700 minimum referenced above. We may be unable to enter into a new supply agreement or extend our existing supply agreement with Lotus on terms and conditions

acceptable to us. In such event, we may be required to contract with another third party to replace Lotus which would entail redesign of the Tesla Roadster chassis, adjustments to our supply chain and establishment of a light manufacturing facility. The expense and time required to complete this transition, and to assure that the vehicles and gliders manufactured at that facility comply with all relevant regulatory requirements, may turn out to be higher than anticipated. Entry into any such contract with another third party might also require us to agree to terms with Lotus on which Lotus would license certain intellectual property rights necessary for the manufacture of the Tesla Roadster to such third party. There can be no assurance that we will be able to find a third party to complete partial manufacture of the Tesla Roadster on terms acceptable to us, if at all and, in addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into an intellectual property rights license with Lotus on terms acceptable to us. Additionally, because we are dependent upon our relationship with Lotus for the manufacturing of the Tesla Roadster, our business depends on Lotus continuing to operate as a viable and solvent entity and to continue to produce the Tesla Roadster vehicles and gliders pursuant to our supply agreement. Any delay or discontinuance by Lotus of delivery of the Tesla Roadster vehicles and gliders or failure by Lotus to produce the vehicles and gliders in accordance with quality standards would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition.
We are dependent on our suppliers, a significant number of which are single or limited source suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to continue to deliver, or their refusal to deliver, necessary components of our vehicles at prices and volumes acceptable to us would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operating results.
The Tesla Roadster uses over 2,000 purchased parts which we source from over 150 suppliers, many of whom are currently single source suppliers for these components. Our supply base is located globally, with about 30% of our suppliers located in North America, 40% in Europe and 30% in Asia. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our vehicles must be custom made for us. We refer to these component suppliers as our single source suppliers. In addition, Lotus is the only manufacturer for certain components, such as the chassis of our Tesla Roadster, and we refer to it as a sole source supplier.
This supply chain exposes us to multiple potential sources of delivery failure or component shortages for the Tesla Roadster and the planned Model S. We are currently evaluating, qualifying and selecting our suppliers for the planned production of the Model S and we intend to establish dual suppliers for several key components of the Model S, although we expect that a number of components for the Model S will be single sourced. To date we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our single source and sole source suppliers. While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain replacement components, we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices that are favorable to us. In addition, replacing our sole source components may require us to reengineer our vehicles, which could be time consuming and costly. We have in the past experienced source disruptions in our supply chains which have caused delays in our production process and we may experience additional delays in the future.
Changes in business conditions, wars, governmental changes, and other factors beyond our control or which we do not presently anticipate, could also affect our suppliers’ ability to deliver components to us on a timely basis. Furthermore, if we experience significant increased demand, or need to replace our existing suppliers, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of component parts will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, or that any supplier would allocate sufficient supplies to us in order to meet our requirements or fill our orders in a timely manner. In the past, we have replaced certain suppliers because of their failure to provide components that met our quality control standards. The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers, which could hurt our relationships with our customers and also materially adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results.

Changes in our supply chain have resulted in the past, and may result in the future, in increased cost and delay. For example, a change in our supplier for our carbon fiber body panels contributed to the delay in our ability to ramp our production of the Tesla Roadster. A failure by our suppliers to provide the components necessary to manufacture our performance electric vehicles could prevent us from fulfilling customer orders in a timely fashion which could result in negative publicity, damage our brand and have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects and operating results. In addition, since we have no fixed pricing arrangements with any of our component suppliers other than Lotus, our component suppliers could increase their prices with little or no notice to us, which could harm our financial condition and operating results if we are unable to pass such price increases along to our customers.
Increases in costs, disruption of supply or shortage of raw materials, in particular lithium-ion cells, could harm our business.
We may experience increases in the cost or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of raw materials. Any such an increase or supply interruption could materially negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, carbon fiber, non-ferrous metals such as copper, as well as cobalt. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials and could adversely affect our business and operating results. For instance, we are exposed to multiple risks relating to price fluctuations for lithium-ion cells. These risks include:
 
 	•	 	
the inability or unwillingness of current battery manufacturers to build or operate battery cell manufacturing plants to supply the numbers of lithium-ion cells required to support the growth of the electric or plug-in hybrid vehicle industry as demand for such cells increases;

 
 	•	 	
disruption in the supply of cells due to quality issues or recalls by the battery cell manufacturers; and

 
 	•	 	
an increase in the cost of raw materials, such as cobalt, used in lithium-ion cells.

Our business is dependent on the continued supply of battery cells for our vehicles. While we believe several sources of the battery cell we have selected for the Tesla Roadster are available, we have fully qualified only one supplier for these cells. Any disruption is the supply of battery cells from such vendor could temporarily disrupt production of the Tesla Roadster until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified. Moreover, battery cell manufacturers may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe. Furthermore, current fluctuations or shortages in petroleum and other economic conditions may cause us to experience significant increases in freight charges and raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs, and could reduce our margins if we cannot recoup the increased costs through increased electric vehicle prices. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recoup increasing costs of raw materials by increasing vehicle prices. We have also already announced an estimated price for the base model of our planned Model S. Although we have indicated that final pricing for the Model S will not be known until 2011 at the earliest, an increase in the announced price in response to increased raw material costs could be viewed negatively by our customers, result in cancellations of Model S reservations and could adversely affect our brand, image, business, prospects and operating results.
We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems. If these implementations are not successful, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed.
We are currently expanding and improving our information technology systems to assist us in the management of our business. In particular, our production of the Model S will necessitate the improvement, design and development of more expanded supply chain systems to support our operations as well as production and shop floor management. The implementation of new software management platforms and the addition of
 
32
Table of Contents

these platforms at new locations require significant management time, support and cost. Moreover, there are inherent risks associated with developing, improving and expanding our core systems, including supply chain disruptions that may affect our ability to obtain supplies when needed or to deliver vehicles to our Tesla stores and customers. We cannot be sure that these expanded systems will be fully or effectively implemented on a timely basis, if at all. If we do not successfully implement this project, our operations may be disrupted and our operating results could be harmed. In addition, the new systems may not operate as we expect them to, and we may be required to expend significant resources to correct problems or find alternative sources for performing these functions.
If our vehicle owners customize our vehicles or change the charging infrastructure with aftermarket products, the vehicle may not operate properly which could harm our business.
Automobile enthusiasts may seek to “hack” our vehicles to modify its performance which could compromise vehicle safety systems. Also, we are aware of customers who have customized their vehicles with after-market parts that may compromise driver safety. For example, some customers have installed seats that elevate the driver such that airbag and other safety systems could be compromised. Other customers have changed wheels and tires, while others have installed large speaker systems that may impact the electrical systems of the vehicle. We have not tested, nor do we endorse such changes or products. In addition, customer use of improper external cabling or unsafe charging outlets can expose our customer to injury from high voltage electricity. Such unauthorized modifications could reduce the safety of our vehicles and any injuries resulting from such modifications could result in adverse publicity which would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
The success of our business depends on attracting and retaining a large number of customers. If we are unable to do so, we will not be able to achieve profitability.
Our success depends on attracting a large number of potential customers to purchase our electric vehicles. As of December 31, 2009 we had sold 937 Tesla Roadsters to customers, almost all of which were sold in the United States and Europe, and had accepted reservations for approximately 2,000 Model S sedans. If our existing and prospective customers do not perceive our vehicles and services to be of sufficiently high value and quality, and appealing in aesthetics or performance, or if the final production version of the Model S is not sufficiently similar to the drivable design prototype, we may not be able to retain our current customers or attract new customers, and our business and prospects, operating results and financial condition would suffer as a result. In addition, because our performance electric vehicles to date have been sold largely through word of mouth marketing efforts, we may be required to incur significantly higher and more sustained advertising and promotional expenditures than we have previously incurred to attract customers, and use more traditional advertising techniques. In addition, if we engage in traditional advertising, we may face review by consumer protection enforcement agencies and may incur significant expenses to ensure that our advertising claims are fully supported. To date we have limited experience selling our electric vehicles and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining a large number of customers. For example, over half of our current sales team has less than one year of experience in selling our performance electric vehicles. If for any of these reasons we are not able to attract and maintain customers, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition would be materially harmed.
Regulators could review our practice of taking reservation payments and, if the practice is deemed to violate applicable law, we could be required to pay penalties or refund the reservation payments that we have received for vehicles that are not immediately available for delivery, to stop accepting additional reservation payments, to restructure certain aspects of our reservation program, and potentially to suspend or revoke our licenses to manufacture and sell our vehicles.
To reserve a production slot, we require our customers to pay reservation payments, which may be used towards the purchase price for our vehicles in advance of delivery of the vehicle. Our reservation payments are
 
33
Table of Contents

used by us to fund, in part, our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand. For our 2010 model year Tesla Roadsters, our current reservations policy requires the payment of an initial $9,900, €9,900 or £8,500 reservation payment, depending on the location of the customer. Approximately three months prior to production, we require the customer to make full payment of the balance owed on the vehicle to lock in a production slot. For the Model S, we require an initial reservation payment of at least $5,000. Until the customer locks in a production slot, reservation payments are refundable, less certain cancellation fees. As of September 30, 2009, we had collected reservation payments for undelivered Tesla Roadsters in an aggregate amount of $9.3 million and reservation payments for Model S sedans in an aggregate amount of $15.2 million. At this time, we do not plan to hold reservation payments separately or in an escrow or trust fund or pay any interest on reservation payments except to the extent applicable laws require us to do so. We generally use these funds for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
California laws, and potentially the laws of other states, restrict the ability of licensed auto dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles before the vehicles are available to the dealer from the manufacturer. In November 2007, we became aware that the New Motor Vehicle Board of the California Department of Transportation has considered whether our reservation policies and advertising comply with the California Vehicle Code. To date, we have not received any communications on this topic from the New Motor Vehicle Board or the Department of Motor Vehicles, or DMV, which has the power to enforce these laws. There can be no assurance that the DMV will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law. We expect that if the DMV determines that we may have violated the law, it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance. If we are ultimately found to be in violation of California law, we might be precluded from taking reservation payments, and the DMV could take other actions against us, including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments. Resolution of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program. In addition, California is currently the only jurisdiction in which we have licenses to both manufacture and sell our vehicles so any limitation imposed on our operations in California would be particularly damaging to our business. The DMV also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in California, following a hearing on the merits, which it has typically exercised in cases of significant or repeat violations and/or a refusal to comply with DMV directions.
Certain states may have specific laws which apply to dealers, or manufacturers selling directly to consumers, or both. For example, the state of Washington requires that reservation payments or other payments received from residents in the state of Washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle, which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer. Consequently, we established a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of Washington in January 2010. There can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payments received from customers. Our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity.
Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time.
If our vehicle reservation or advertising practices or other business practices were found to violate the laws of a jurisdiction, we may face exposure under those laws and our business and prospects would be adversely affected. For example, if we are required to return reservation payment amounts, we may need to raise additional funds to make such payments. There can be no assurance that such funding would be available on a timely basis on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If a court were to find that our reservation agreement or advertising does not comply with state laws, we may face exposure under those laws which may include exposure under consumer protection statutes such as those that deal with unfair competition and false advertising. Moreover,

reductions in our cash as a result of redemptions or an inability to take reservation payments could also make it more difficult for us to obtain additional financing. The prospect of reductions in cash, even if unrealized, may also make it more difficult to obtain financing.
Our plan to expand our network of Tesla stores will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles. In addition, we may not be able to open stores in certain states.
Our plan to expand our network of Tesla stores will require significant cash investments and management resources and may not meet our expectations with respect to additional sales of our electric vehicles. This planned global expansion of Tesla stores may not have the desired effect of increasing sales and expanding our brand presence to the degree we are anticipating. Furthermore there can be no assurances that we will be able to construct additional storefronts on the budget or timeline we have established. We will also need to ensure we are in compliance with any regulatory requirements applicable to the sale of our vehicles in those jurisdictions, which could take considerable time and expense. If we experience any delays in expanding our network of Tesla stores, this could lead to a decrease in sales of our vehicles and could negatively impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. As of December 31, 2009, we had opened 10 Tesla stores in major metropolitan areas throughout the United States and Europe. We plan to nearly double the number of Tesla stores opened by the end of 2010, with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within the next several years in connection with the planned Model S rollout. However, we may not be able to expand our network at such rate and our planned expansion of our network of Tesla stores will require significant cash investment and management resources, as well as efficiency in the execution of establishing these storefronts and in hiring and training the necessary employees to effectively sell our vehicles.
Furthermore, certain states and foreign jurisdictions may have permit requirements, franchise dealer laws or similar laws or regulations that may preclude or restrict our ability to open stores or sell vehicles out of such states and jurisdictions. Any such prohibition or restriction may lead to decreased sales in such jurisdictions, which could harm our business and operating results.
We face risks associated with our international operations, including unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business.
We face risks associated with our international operations, including possible unfavorable regulatory, political, tax and labor conditions, which could harm our business. We currently have international operations and subsidiaries in the United Kingdom, Canada, Monaco, Germany and Taiwan that are subject to the legal, political, regulatory and social requirements and economic conditions in these jurisdictions. Additionally, as part of our growth strategy, we intend to expand our sales, maintenance and repair services internationally. However, we have limited experience to date selling and servicing our vehicles internationally and such expansion would require us to make significant expenditures, including the hiring of local employees and establishing facilities, in advance of generating any revenue. We are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that may increase our costs, impact our ability to sell our electric vehicles and require significant management attention. These risks include:
 
 	•	 	
conforming our vehicles to various international regulatory requirements where our vehicles are sold, or homologation;

 
 	•	 	
difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations;

 
 	•	 	
difficulties attracting customers in new jurisdictions;

 
 	•	 	
foreign government taxes, regulations and permit requirements, including foreign taxes that we may not be able to offset against taxes imposed upon us in the United States, and foreign tax and other laws limiting our ability to repatriate funds to the United States;

 
35
Table of Contents

 	•	 	
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including risks related to any interest rate swap or other hedging activities we undertake;

 
 	•	 	
our ability to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights, especially in those foreign countries that do not respect and protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the United States, Japan and European countries, which increases the risk of unauthorized, and uncompensated, use of our technology;

 
 	•	 	
United States and foreign government trade restrictions, tariffs and price or exchange controls;

 
 	•	 	
foreign labor laws, regulations and restrictions;

 
 	•	 	
preferences of foreign nations for domestically produced vehicles;

 
 	•	 	
changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;

 
 	•	 	
political instability, natural disasters, war or events of terrorism; and

 
 	•	 	
the strength of international economies.

We also face the risk that costs denominated in foreign currencies will increase if such foreign currencies strengthen quickly and significantly against the dollar. A portion of our costs and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 were denominated in foreign currencies such as the British Pound and the euro. This is primarily due to the contract with Lotus in the United Kingdom to assemble the Tesla Roadster vehicles and gliders and other parts sourced in Europe. If the value of the United States dollar continues to depreciate against the British pound and the Euro, our costs as measured in United States dollars will correspondingly increase and our operating results will be adversely affected. In addition, our battery cell purchases from Asian suppliers are subject to currency risk. Although our present contracts are United States dollar based, if the United States dollar depreciates significantly against the local currency it could cause our Asian suppliers to significantly raise their prices, which could harm our financial results.
If we fail to successfully address these risks, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.
The unavailability, reduction or elimination of government and economic incentives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.
Any reduction, elimination or discriminatory application of government subsidies and economic incentives because of policy changes, the reduced need for such subsidies and incentives due to the perceived success of the electric vehicle, fiscal tightening or other reasons may result in the diminished competitiveness of the alternative fuel vehicle industry generally or our electric vehicles in particular. This could materially and adversely affect the growth of the alternative fuel automobile markets and our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
Our growth depends in part on the availability and amounts of government subsidies and economic incentives for alternative fuel vehicles generally and performance electric vehicles specifically. For example, in December 2009, we finalized an arrangement with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority that will result in an exemption from California state sales and use taxes for up to $320 million of manufacturing equipment. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state sales and use tax, we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately $31 million over a three year period starting in December 2009. This exemption is only available for equipment that would otherwise be subject to California sales and use taxes and that would be used only for the following three purposes: to establish our production facility for the Model S sedan, to upgrade our Palo Alto powertrain production facility, and to expand our current Tesla Roadster assembly operations at our Menlo Park facility. If we fail to meet these conditions, we would be unable to take full advantage of this tax incentive and our financial position could be harmed.

In addition, certain regulations that encourage sales of electric cars could be reduced, eliminated or applied in a way that creates an adverse effect against our vehicles, either currently or at any time in the future. For example, while the federal and state governments have from time to time enacted tax credits and other incentives for the purchase of alternative fuel cars, our competitors have more experience and greater resources in working with legislators than we do, and so there is no guarantee that our vehicles would be eligible for tax credits or other incentives provided to alternative fuel vehicles in the future. This would put our vehicles at a competitive disadvantage. As another example, government disincentives have been enacted in Europe for gas-powered vehicles, which discourage the use of such vehicles and allow us to set a higher sales price for the Tesla Roadster in Europe. In the event that such disincentives are reduced or eliminated, sales of electric vehicles, including our Tesla Roadster, could be adversely affected. Furthermore, low volume manufacturers are exempt from certain regulatory requirements in the United States and the European Union. This provides us with an advantage over high volume manufacturers that must comply with such regulations. Once we reach a certain threshold number of sales in each of the United States and the European Union, we will no longer be able to take advantage of such exemptions in the respective jurisdictions, which could lead us to incur additional design and manufacturing expense. We do not anticipate that we will be able to take advantage of these exemptions with respect to the Model S which we plan to produce at significantly higher volumes than the Tesla Roadster.
If we are unable to grow our sales of electric vehicle components to original equipment manufacturers, our financial results may suffer.
We may have trouble attracting and retaining powertrain customers which could adversely affect our business prospects and results. Daimler is currently the sole customer of our electric powertrain business. In May 2009, we formalized a development agreement with Daimler as a result of which we performed specified research and development services. In addition, we have been selected by Daimler to supply it with up to 1,000 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive in five European cities. We began shipping the first of these battery packs and chargers in November 2009 and started to recognize revenue for these sales in the quarter ended December 31, 2009. There is no guarantee that we will be able to secure future business with Daimler as it has indicated its intent to produce all of its lithium-ion batteries by 2012 as part of a joint venture with Evonik Industries AG. If Daimler goes through with this, we are likely to lose the only customer in our powertrain business. Other than our agreement with Daimler, we have no significant development or sales agreements in place to drive our electric powertrain revenues. Even if we do develop such relationships, there is no assurance that we can adequately pursue such opportunities simultaneously with the execution of our plans for our vehicles.
Our relationship with Daimler is subject to various risks which could adversely affect our business and future prospects.
Daimler has agreed to purchase components of our electric powertrain to support a trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive in five European cities. In addition, we are negotiating agreements for Daimler to provide us with access to various parts, automotive support and engineering for the Model S and regarding various other areas of strategic cooperation with Daimler although there are no assurances that we will be able to enter into any such agreements. However, our relationship with Daimler poses various risks to us including:
 
 	•	 	
potential delays in launching the Model S if we lose Daimler’s automotive support and are unable to find an alternative in a timely manner;

 
 	•	 	
potential loss of access to various parts that we are incorporating into our Model S design; and

 
 	•	 	
potential loss of business and adverse publicity to our brand image if there are defects or other problems discovered with our electric powertrain components that Daimler has incorporated into their vehicles.

The occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results.
In addition, our exclusivity and intellectual property agreement, or EIP Agreement, with Daimler North America Corporation, or DNAC, an affiliate of Daimler provides that, if a Daimler competitor offers to enter into a competitive strategic transaction with us, we are required to give DNAC notice of such offer and DNAC will have a specified period of time in which to notify us whether it wishes to enter into such transaction with us on the same terms as offered by the third party. Because we will be able to enter into such a transaction with a third party only if DNAC declines to do so, this may decrease the likelihood that we will receive offers from third parties to enter into strategic arrangements in the future.
We may not be able to identify adequate strategic relationship opportunities, or form strategic relationships, in the future.
Strategic business relationships will be an important factor in the growth and success of our business. For example, our strategic relationship with Daimler has provided us with various benefits. However, there are no assurances that we will be able to identify or secure suitable business relationship opportunities in the future or our competitors may capitalize on such opportunities before we do. Our strategic relationship with Daimler involved Blackstar, an affiliate of Daimler, making a significant equity investment in us as well as a representative from Daimler, Dr. Herbert Kohler, joining our Board. We may not be able to offer similar benefits to other companies that we would like to establish and maintain strategic relationships with which could impair our ability to establish such relationships. Moreover, identifying such opportunities could demand substantial management time and resources, and negotiating and financing relationships involves significant costs and uncertainties. If we are unable to successfully source and execute on strategic relationship opportunities in the future, our overall growth could be impaired, and our operating results could be adversely affected.
If we fail to manage future growth effectively, we may not be able to market and sell our vehicles successfully.
Any failure to manage our growth effectively could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. We have recently expanded our operations significantly, increasing our total number of employees from 279 as of December 31, 2007 to 514 as of December 31, 2009 and further significant expansion will be required, especially in connection with the planned establishment of our Model S production facility, our electric powertrain manufacturing facility, the expansion of our network of Tesla stores and services centers, our mobile Tesla Rangers program and requirements of being a public company. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Risks that we face in undertaking this expansion include:
 
 	•	 	
training new personnel;

 
 	•	 	
forecasting production and revenue;

 
 	•	 	
controlling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations;

 
 	•	 	
establishing or expanding design, manufacturing, sales and service facilities;

 
 	•	 	
implementing and enhancing administrative infrastructure, systems and processes;

 
 	•	 	
addressing new markets; and

 
 	•	 	
expanding international operations.

We intend to continue to hire a significant number of additional personnel, including design and manufacturing personnel and service technicians for our performance electric vehicles. Because our high-performance vehicles are based on a different technology platform than traditional internal combustion engines, individuals with sufficient training in performance electric vehicles may not be available to hire, and we will
 
38
Table of Contents

need to expend significant time and expense training the employees we do hire. Competition for individuals with experience designing, manufacturing and servicing electric vehicles is intense, and we may not be able to attract, assimilate, train or retain additional highly qualified personnel in the future. The failure to attract, integrate, train, motivate and retain these additional employees could seriously harm our business and prospects.
If we are unable to attract and retain key employees and hire qualified management, technical and vehicle engineering personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.
The loss of the services of any of our key employees could disrupt our operations, delay the development and introduction of our vehicles and services, and negatively impact our business, prospects and operating results. In particular, we are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman of our Board of Directors, and JB Straubel, our Chief Technical Officer. None of our key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully attract and retain senior leadership necessary to grow our business. Our future success depends upon our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key technology, sales, marketing and support personnel and any failure to do so could adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. We have in the past and may in the future experience difficulty in retaining members of our senior management team. In addition, we do not have “key person” life insurance policies covering any of our officers or other key employees. There is increasing competition for talented individuals with the specialized knowledge of electric vehicles and this competition affects both our ability to retain key employees and hire new ones.
We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer.
We are highly dependent on the services of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect, Chairman of our Board of Directors and largest stockholder. Although Mr. Musk spends significant time with Tesla and is highly active in our management, he does not devote his full time and attention to Tesla. Mr. Musk also currently serves as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technical Officer of Space Exploration Technologies, a developer and manufacturer of space launch vehicles, and Chairman of SolarCity, a solar equipment installation company.
In addition, our financing agreements with Blackstar contain certain covenants relating to Mr. Musk’s employment as our Chief Executive Officer. These covenants provide that if Mr. Musk is not serving as our Chief Executive Officer at any time until the later of December 31, 2012 or the launch of the Model S, Mr. Musk shall promptly propose a successor Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Kohler, or his successor, must consent to any appointment of such person by our Board of Directors. If Mr. Musk departs as our Chief Executive Officer prior to December 31, 2010, for reasons other than his death or disability, and Dr. Kohler, or his successor, has not consented to the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Daimler has the right to terminate any or all of its strategic collaboration agreements with us. Furthermore, if at any time during the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012, Mr. Musk is not serving as either our Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of our Board of Directors for reasons other than his death or disability, and Dr. Kohler, or his successor, has not consented to the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer or if during such period Mr. Musk renders services to, or invests in, any other automotive OEM other than us, Daimler has the right to terminate any or all of its strategic collaboration agreements with us. If this were to occur, our business would be harmed.
Furthermore, our DOE Loan Facility provides that we will be in default under the facility in the event Mr. Musk and certain of his affiliates fail to own, at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating to the Model S, at least 65% of the capital stock held by Mr. Musk and such affiliates as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility.

Many members of our management team are new to the company or to the automobile industry, and execution of our business plan and development strategy could be seriously harmed if integration of our management team into our company is not successful.
Our business could be seriously harmed if integration of our management team into our company is not successful. We expect that it will take time for our new management team to integrate into our company and it is too early to predict whether this integration will be successful. We have recently experienced significant changes in our management team and expect to continue to experience significant growth in our management team. Our senior management team has only limited experience working together as a group. Specifically, two of the five members of our senior management team have joined us within the last two years. For example, Deepak Ahuja, our Chief Financial Officer, joined us in July 2008, and Gilbert Passin, our Vice President of Manufacturing, joined us in January 2010. This lack of long-term experience working together may impact the team’s ability to collectively quickly and efficiently respond to problems and effectively manage our business. Although we are taking steps to add senior management personnel that have significant automotive experience, many of the members of our current senior management team have limited or no prior experience in the automobile or electric vehicle industries.
We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs upon us and cause delays in building our manufacturing facilities.
As an automobile manufacturer, we and our operations, both in the United States and abroad, are subject to national, state, provincial and/or local environmental laws and regulations, including laws relating to the use, handling, storage, disposal and human exposure to hazardous materials. Environmental laws and regulations can be complex and we expect that our business and operations will be affected by other new environmental and health and safety laws which may require us to change our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. These laws can give rise to liability for administrative oversight costs, cleanup costs, property damage, bodily injury and fines and penalties. Capital and operating expenses needed to comply with environmental laws and regulations can be significant, and violations may result in substantial fines and penalties, third party damages, suspension of production or a cessation of our operations. In addition, ensuring we are in compliance with applicable environmental laws in connection with our planned Model S manufacturing facility and our planned electric powertrain manufacturing facility in Palo Alto, California, such as the California Environmental Quality Act, could require significant time and management and financial resources and could cause delays in our ability to build out, equip and operate these facilities, which would adversely impact our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our DOE Loan Facility conditions the availability of the full amount of the loans on meeting certain environmental requirements relating to the sites on which our Model S manufacturing facility and our electric powertrain facility are located, including the National Environmental Policy Act and any environmental issues with respect to these sites could limit or delay our ability to draw down the full amount of the loans under our DOE Loan Facility.
In addition, environmental laws and regulations, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or CERCLA, in the United States can impose liability for the full amount of damages without regard to comparative fault for the investigation and cleanup of contaminated soil and ground water, for building contamination and impacts to human health and for damages to natural resources. Contamination at properties formerly owned or operated by us, as well as at properties we will own and operate, and properties to which hazardous substances were sent by us, may result in liability for us under environmental laws and regulations. The costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations and any claims concerning noncompliance, or liability with respect to contamination in the future could, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results.
We may not be able to obtain, or to agree on acceptable terms and conditions for, all or a significant portion of the government grants, loans and other incentives for which we have applied and may in the future apply. As a result, our business and prospects may be adversely affected.
We have applied for federal and state grants, loans and tax incentives under government programs designed to stimulate the economy and support the production of electric vehicles and related technologies. We anticipate
 
40
Table of Contents

that in the future there will be new opportunities for us to apply for grants, loans and other incentives from the United States, state and foreign governments. Our ability to obtain funds or incentives from government sources is subject to the availability of funds under applicable government programs and approval of our applications to participate in such programs. The application process for these funds and other incentives is and will be highly competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining any of these additional grants, loans and other incentives. If we are not successful in obtaining any of these additional incentives and we are unable to find alternative sources of funding to meet our planned capital needs, our business and prospects could be adversely affected.
Our business may be adversely affected by union activities.
Although none of our employees are currently represented by a labor union, it is common throughout the automobile industry generally for many employees at automobile companies to belong to a union, which can result in higher employee costs and increased risk of work stoppages. As we expand our business to include full in-house manufacturing of our vehicles, as is planned for the Model S, there can be no assurances that our employees will not join or form a labor union or that we will not be required to become a union signatory. We are also directly or indirectly dependent upon companies with unionized work forces, such as parts suppliers and trucking and freight companies, and work stoppages or strikes organized by such unions could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results. For example, certain employees at the sea freight companies through which we ship our Tesla Roadster gliders to the United States after assembly in England may be represented by unions, as may be employees at certain of our suppliers. If a work stoppage occurs, it could delay the manufacture and sale of our performance electric vehicles and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.
We are subject to substantial regulation, which is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.
Our performance electric vehicles, the sale of motor vehicles in general and the electronic components used in our vehicles are subject to substantial regulation under international, federal, state, and local laws. We have incurred, and expect to incur in the future, significant costs in complying with these regulations. For example, the Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board with respect to emissions for our vehicles. We received a Certificate of Conformity for sales of our Tesla Roadsters in 2008, but did not receive a Certificate of Conformity for sales of the Tesla Roadster in 2009 until December 21, 2009. In January 2010, we and the EPA entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Audit Policy Determination in which we agreed to pay a civil administrative penalty in the sum of $275,000 for failing to obtain a Certificate of Conformity for sales of our vehicles in 2009 prior to December 21, 2009.
Regulations related to the electric vehicle industry and alternative energy are currently evolving and we face risks associated with changes to these regulations such as:
 
 	•	 	
the imposition of a carbon tax or the introduction of a cap-and-trade system on electric utilities could increase the cost of electricity;

 
 	•	 	
the increase of subsidies for corn and ethanol production could reduce the operating cost of vehicles that use ethanol or a combination of ethanol and gasoline;

 
 	•	 	
changes to the regulations governing the assembly and transportation of lithium-ion batteries, such as the UN Recommendations of the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations or regulations adopted by the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, could increase the cost of lithium-ion batteries;

 
 	•	 	
the amendment or rescission of the federal law mandating increased fuel economy in the United States, referred to as the “Corporate Average Fuel Economy” or “CAFE” standards could reduce new business opportunities for our powertrain business;

 
41
Table of Contents

 	•	 	
increased sensitivity by regulators to the needs of established automobile manufacturers with large employment bases, high fixed costs and business models based on the internal combustion engine could lead them to pass regulations that could reduce the compliance costs of such established manufacturers or mitigate the effects of government efforts to promote alternative fuel vehicles; and

 
 	•	 	
changes to regulations governing exporting of our products could increase our costs incurred to deliver products outside the United States or force us to charge a higher price for our vehicles in such jurisdictions.

To the extent the laws change, some or all of our vehicles may not comply with applicable international, federal, state or local laws, which would have an adverse effect on our business. Compliance with changing regulations could be burdensome, time consuming, and expensive. To the extent compliance with new regulations is cost prohibitive, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.
We retain certain personal information about our customers and may be subject to various privacy and consumer protection laws.
We use our vehicles’ electronic systems to log information about each vehicle’s use in order to aid us in vehicle diagnostics, repair and maintenance, as well as to help us collect data regarding our customers’ charge time, battery usage, mileage and efficiency habits. Our customers may object to the use of this data, which may harm our business. Possession and use of our customers’ personal information in conducting our business may subject us to legislative and regulatory burdens in the United States and foreign jurisdictions that could require notification of data breach, restrict our use of such personal information and hinder our ability to acquire new customers or market to existing customers. We may incur significant expenses to comply with privacy, consumer protection and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. If third parties improperly obtain and use the personal information of our customers, we may be required to expend significant resources to resolve these problems. A major breach of our network security and systems could have serious negative consequences for our businesses and future prospects, including possible fines, penalties and damages, reduced customer demand for our vehicles, and harm to our reputation and brand.
Our vehicles make use of lithium-ion battery cells, which on rare occasions have been observed to catch fire or vent smoke and flame.
The battery pack in the Tesla Roadster makes use of lithium-ion cells, which have been used for years in laptops and cell phones. We also currently intend to make use of lithium-ion cells in the battery pack for the Model S and any future vehicles we may produce. On rare occasions, lithium-ion cells can rapidly release the energy they contain by venting smoke and flames in a manner that can ignite nearby materials. Highly publicized incidents of laptop computers and cell phones bursting into flames have focused consumer attention on the safety of these cells. The events have also raised questions about the suitability of these lithium-ion cells for automotive applications. To address these questions and concerns, a number of cell manufacturers are pursuing alternative lithium-ion battery cell chemistries to improve safety. We have designed our battery pack to passively contain any single cell’s release of energy without spreading to neighboring cells and we are not aware of any such incident in our customers’ vehicles. We have tested the batteries and subjected them to damaging treatments such as baking, overcharging, crushing or puncturing to assess our battery pack’s response to deliberate and sometimes destructive abuse. However, we have delivered only a limited number of Tesla Roadsters to customers and have limited field experience with our vehicles. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that a field failure of our battery packs will not occur, which could damage the vehicle or lead to personal injury or death and may subject us to lawsuits. In addition, we store a significant number of lithium-ion cells at our manufacturing facility. Any mishandling of battery cells may cause disruption to the operation of our facilities. While we have implemented safety procedures related to the handling of the cells, there can be no assurance that a safety issue or fire related to the cells would not disrupt our operations. Such damage or injury would likely lead to adverse
 
42
Table of Contents

publicity and potentially a safety recall. Moreover, any failure of a competitor’s electric vehicle, especially those that use a high volume of commodity cells similar to the Tesla Roadster, may cause indirect adverse publicity for us. Such adverse publicity would negatively affect our brand and harm our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.
We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our financial condition and liquidity if we are not able to successfully defend or insure against such claims.
We may become subject to product liability claims, which could harm our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. The automobile industry experiences significant product liability claims and we face inherent risk of exposure to claims in the event our vehicles do not perform as expected or malfunction resulting in personal injury or death. Our risks in this area are particularly pronounced given the limited number of vehicles delivered to date and limited field experience of those vehicles. A successful product liability claim against us could require us to pay a substantial monetary award. Moreover, a product liability claim could generate substantial negative publicity about our vehicles and business and inhibit or prevent commercialization of other future vehicle candidates which would have material adverse effect on our brand, business, prospects and operating results. We maintain product liability insurance for all our vehicles with annual limits of approximately $21 million on a claims made basis, but we cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient to cover all potential product liability claims. Any lawsuit seeking significant monetary damages either in excess of our coverage, or outside of our coverage, may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial condition. We may not be able to secure additional product liability insurance coverage on commercially acceptable terms or at reasonable costs when needed, particularly if we do face liability for our products and are forced to make a claim under our policy.
In connection with the development and sale of our planned Model S, we will need to comply with various additional safety regulations and requirements that were not applicable to the sales of our Tesla Roadsters, with which it may be expensive or difficult to comply. For example, we will need to pass certain frontal impact tests for the Model S, which are required for sales exceeding certain annual volumes outside the United States. We performed such a test on the Tesla Roadster based on European Union testing standards in connection with sales exceeding certain volume thresholds in Australia and Japan, and two criteria were not met in the test. We may experience difficulties in meeting all the criteria for this test or similar tests for our planned Model S, which may delay our ability to sell the Model S in high volumes in certain jurisdictions.
We may be compelled to undertake product recalls.
Any product recall in the future may result in adverse publicity, damage our brand and adversely affect our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition. In April 2009, we determined that a condition caused by insufficient torquing of the rear inner hub flange bolt existed in some of our Tesla Roadsters, as a result of a missed process during manufacture of the Tesla Roadster glider. Based on our internal investigation results and in coordination with NHTSA, we initiated a product recall in May 2009. The May 2009 recall resulted in approximately 346 Tesla Roadsters needing to be serviced. In the future, we may at various times, voluntarily or involuntarily, initiate a recall if any of our vehicles or electric powertrain components prove to be defective. Such recalls, voluntary or involuntary, involve significant expense and diversion of management attention and other resources, which would adversely affect our brand image in our target markets and could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Our warranty reserves may be insufficient to cover future warranty claims which could adversely affect our financial performance.
If our warranty reserves are inadequate to cover future warranty claims on our vehicles, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. We provide a three year or 36,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty with every Tesla Roadster, which we extended to four
 
43
Table of Contents

years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. In addition, customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service Plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty is similar to other vehicle manufacturers’ warranty programs and is intended to cover all parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems, battery, powertrain and brake system. We record and adjust warranty reserves based on changes in estimated costs and actual warranty costs. However, because we only began delivering our first Tesla Roadster in early 2008, we have extremely limited operating experience with our vehicles, and therefore little experience with warranty claims for these vehicles or with estimating warranty reserves. Since we began initiating sales of our vehicles, we have increased our warranty reserves based on our actual warranty claim experience over the past 12 months and we may be required to undertake further such increases in the future. As of September 30, 2009, we had warranty reserves of $4.3 million. We could in the future become subject to a significant and unexpected warranty expense. There can be no assurances that our existing warranty reserves will be sufficient to cover all claims or that our limited experience with warranty claims will adequately address the needs of our customers to their satisfaction.
We may need to defend ourselves against patent or trademark infringement claims, which may be time-consuming and would cause us to incur substantial costs.
Companies, organizations or individuals, including our competitors, may hold or obtain patents, trademarks or other proprietary rights that would prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use, develop or sell our vehicles or components, which could make it more difficult for us to operate our business. From time to time, we may receive inquiries from holders of patents or trademarks inquiring whether we infringe their proprietary rights. Companies holding patents or other intellectual property rights relating to battery packs, electric motors or electronic power management systems may bring suits alleging infringement of such rights or otherwise asserting their rights and seeking licenses. In addition, if we are determined to have infringed upon a third party’s intellectual property rights, we may be required to do one or more of the following:
 
 	•	 	
cease selling, incorporating or using vehicles that incorporate the challenged intellectual property;

 
 	•	 	
pay substantial damages;

 
 	•	 	
obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right, which license may not be available on reasonable terms or at all; or

 
 	•	 	
redesign our vehicles.

In the event of a successful claim of infringement against us and our failure or inability to obtain a license to the infringed technology, our business, prospects, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, any litigation or claims, whether or not valid, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention.
We also license patents and other intellectual property from third parties, and we may face claims that our use of this in-licensed technology infringes the rights of others. In that case, we may seek indemnification from our licensors under our license contracts with them. However, our rights to indemnification may be unavailable or insufficient to cover our costs and losses, depending on our use of the technology, whether we choose to retain control over conduct of the litigation, and other factors.
Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use or infringement by third parties.
Any failure to protect our proprietary rights adequately could result in our competitors offering similar products, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our competitive advantage and a decrease in our revenue which would adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Our success
 
44
Table of Contents

depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2009, we had 8 issued patents and 89 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as numerous foreign patent applications in a broad range of areas related to our powertrain. We have also received from third parties patent licenses related to manufacturing our vehicles.
The protection provided by the patent laws is and will be important to our future opportunities. However, such patents and agreements and various other measures we take to protect our intellectual property from use by others may not be effective for various reasons, including the following:
 
 	•	 	
our pending patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents;

 
 	•	 	
our patents, if issued, may not be broad enough to protect our proprietary rights;

 
 	•	 	
the patents we have been granted may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented because of the pre-existence of similar patented or unpatented intellectual property rights or for other reasons;

 
 	•	 	
the costs associated with enforcing patents, confidentiality and invention agreements or other intellectual property rights may make aggressive enforcement impracticable;

 
 	•	 	
current and future competitors may independently develop similar technology, duplicate our vehicles or design new vehicles in a way that circumvents our patents; and

 
 	•	 	
our in-licensed patents may be invalidated or the holders of these patents may seek to breach our license arrangements.

Existing trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements afford only limited protection. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult.
Our patent applications may not result in issued patents, which may have a material adverse effect on our ability to prevent others from commercially exploiting products similar to ours.
We cannot be certain that we are the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on these inventions, nor can we be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor. In addition, patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws, rules and procedures that differ from those of the United States, and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued U.S. patents will be issued. Furthermore, if these patent applications issue, some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than in the United States.
The status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain. As a result, we cannot be certain that the patent applications that we file will result in patents being issued, or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us in the near future will afford protection against competitors with similar technology. In addition, patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around, either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our business, prospects and operating results.
Two of our trademark applications in the European Union remain subject to four outstanding opposition proceedings.
We currently sell and market our vehicles in the European Union under the Tesla trademark. We have two trademark applications in the European Union for the Tesla trademark. These are subject to outstanding opposition proceedings brought by two prior owners of trademarks consisting of the word Tesla. If we cannot
 
45
Table of Contents

resolve the oppositions and thereby secure registered rights in the European Union, this will reduce our ability to challenge third party users of the Tesla trademark and dilute the value of the mark as our exclusive brand name in the European Union. In addition, there is a risk that these prior rights owners could in the future take action to challenge our use of the Tesla mark in the European Union. This would have a severe impact on our position in the European Union and may inhibit our ability to use the Tesla mark in the European Union. If we were prevented from using the Tesla trademark in the European Union, we would need to expend significant additional financial and marketing resources on establishing an alternative brand identity in these markets.
Our facilities or operations could be damaged or adversely affected as a result of disasters or unpredictable events.
Our corporate headquarters and planned manufacturing facilities are located in California, a region known for seismic activity. If major disasters such as earthquakes, fires, floods, hurricanes, wars, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, pandemics or other events occur, or our information system or communications network breaks down or operates improperly, our facilities may be seriously damaged, or we may have to stop or delay production and shipment of our products. In addition, our lease for our Deer Creek Facility permits the landlord to terminate the lease following a casualty event if the needed repairs are in excess of certain thresholds and we do not agree to pay for any uninsured amounts. We may incur expenses relating to such damages, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.
In the past material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting have been identified. If we fail to remediate any material weaknesses and maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.
In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended and as of December 31, 2007, our independent registered public accounting firm identified two control deficiencies that represented material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended and as of December 31, 2007. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended and as of December 31, 2008, our independent registered public accounting firm did not identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended and as of December 31, 2008. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal controls in our business could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.
The material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2007, which resulted in audit adjustments, were as follows:
 
 	•	 	
We did not maintain adequate controls to ensure the accuracy, completeness and safeguarding of spreadsheets used in our financial reporting process. Specifically, we maintained many supporting financial schedules on a manual and non-integrated spreadsheet basis, which increased the risk of compiling inaccurate or incomplete information.

 
 	•	 	
We did not maintain effective controls over cut-off procedures for expenses. Specifically, we did not have formal cut-off procedures in place to ensure the timely and accurate recording of accruals.

We have taken steps to remediate our material weaknesses. However, there are no assurances that the measures we have taken to remediate these internal control weaknesses were completely effective or that similar weaknesses will not recur. Our remediation efforts for the material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in 2007 have included:
 
 	•	 	
an increased level of spreadsheet maintenance and review, as well as continuing exploration of automation opportunities;

 
46
Table of Contents

 	•	 	
expanded cross-functional involvement and input into period end expense accruals, as well as process improvements in the procure-to-pay cycle and analytics in establishing certain cost center accruals; and

 
 	•	 	
increased reporting capabilities from our financial and enterprise resource planning systems to monitor and track financial reporting.

Additionally, as part of our on-going efforts to improve our financial accounting organization and processes, we have hired several senior accounting personnel in the United States.
We plan to continue to assess our internal controls and procedures and intend to take further action as necessary or appropriate to address any other matters we identify.
Because of these material weaknesses, there is heightened risk that a material misstatement of our financial statements relating to the years ended and as of December 31, 2007 was not prevented or detected. While no material weaknesses were identified during the course of our audit for the year ended December 31, 2008, we cannot assure you that these or other similar issues will not arise in future periods.
To date, the audit of our consolidated financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm has included a consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis of designing their audit procedures, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If such an evaluation had been performed or when we are required to perform such an evaluation, additional material weaknesses and other control deficiencies may have been or may be identified. Ensuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place to help produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be evaluated frequently. We will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies relating to internal controls, which could materially adversely affect our operating results.
If our suppliers fail to use ethical business practices and comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brand image could be harmed due to negative publicity.
Our core values, which include developing the highest quality electric vehicles while operating with integrity, are an important component of our brand image, which makes our reputation particularly sensitive to allegations of unethical business practices. We do not control our independent suppliers or their business practices. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with ethical business practices, such as environmental responsibility, fair wage practices, and compliance with child labor laws, among others. A lack of demonstrated compliance could lead us to seek alternative suppliers, which could increase our costs and result in delayed delivery of our products, product shortages or other disruptions of our operations.
Violation of labor or other laws by our suppliers or the divergence of an independent supplier’s labor or other practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States or other markets in which we do business could also attract negative publicity for us and our brand. This could diminish the value of our brand image and reduce demand for our performance electric vehicles if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract negative publicity. If we, or other manufacturers in our industry, encounter similar problems in the future, it could harm our brand image, business, prospects and operating results.
Risks Related to this Offering and Ownership of our Common Stock
We will incur increased costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could adversely affect our operating results.
As a public company, we will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company reporting and corporate governance
 
47
Table of Contents

requirements. These requirements include compliance with Section 404 and other provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and the                     . In addition, our management team will also have to adapt to the requirements of being a public company. We expect complying with these rules and regulations will substantially increase our legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time-consuming and costly.
The increased costs associated with operating as a public company will decrease our net income or increase our net loss, and may require us to reduce costs in other areas of our business or increase the prices of our products or services. Additionally, if these requirements divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.
As a public company, we also expect that it may be more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on our board of directors or as our executive officers.
Concentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and their affiliates may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.
Upon completion of this offering, our executive officers, directors and their affiliates will beneficially own, in the aggregate, approximately     % of our outstanding shares of common stock. In particular, Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman of our Board of Directors, will beneficially own approximately     % of our outstanding shares of common stock upon completion of this offering. As a result, these stockholders will be able to exercise a significant level of control over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions. This control could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of our company or changes in management and will make the approval of certain transactions difficult or impossible without the support of these stockholders.
As a result of becoming a public company, we will be obligated to develop and maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting. We may not complete our analysis of our internal control over financial reporting in a timely manner, or these internal controls may not be determined to be effective, which may adversely affect investor confidence in our company and, as a result, the value of our common stock.
We will be required, pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year beginning after the effective date of this offering. This assessment will need to include disclosure of any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting, as well as a statement that our auditors have issued an attestation report on effectiveness of our internal controls.
We are in the very early stages of the costly and challenging process of compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404. We may not be able to remediate future material weaknesses, or to complete our evaluation, testing and any required remediation in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. If we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.

An active, liquid and orderly trading market for our common stock may not develop, the price of our stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of our common stock. The initial public offering price of our common stock will be determined through negotiation with the underwriters. This price will not necessarily reflect the price at which investors in the market will be willing to buy and sell our shares of common stock following this offering. In addition, the trading price of our common stock following this offering is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control.
In addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of companies’ stock, including ours, regardless of actual operating performance. These fluctuations may be even more pronounced in the trading market for our stock shortly following this offering. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.
A total of                     , or     %, of our total outstanding shares after the offering are restricted from immediate resale, but may be sold on a stock exchange in the near future. The large number of shares eligible for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price of our common stock.
The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market after this offering, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our common stock. Based on shares outstanding as of December 31, 2009, we will have              shares of common stock outstanding after this offering. Of these shares, the common stock sold in this offering will be freely tradable in the United States, except for any shares purchased by our “affiliates” as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. The holders of              shares of outstanding common stock have agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to dispose of or hedge any of their common stock during the 180-day period beginning on the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. After the expiration of the 180-day restricted period, these shares may be sold in the public market in the United States, subject to prior registration in the United States, if required, or reliance upon an exemption from U.S. registration, including, in the case of shares held by affiliates or control persons, compliance with the volume restrictions of Rule 144.

Upon completion of this offering, stockholders owning an aggregate of              shares (including              convertible shares) will be entitled, under contracts providing for registration rights, to require us to register shares of our common stock owned by them for public sale in the United States. In addition, we intend to file a registration statement to register the approximately              shares reserved for future issuance under our equity
 
49
Table of Contents

compensation plans. Upon effectiveness of that registration statement, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods and, in certain cases, lock-up agreements with the representatives of the underwriters referred to above, the shares of common stock issued upon exercise of outstanding options will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.
Sales of our common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales also could cause our stock price to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our common stock.
Anti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.
Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions which could have the effect of rendering more difficult, delaying or preventing an acquisition deemed undesirable by our board of directors. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:
 
 	•	 	
creating a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;

 
 	•	 	
authorizing “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by the board without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;

 
 	•	 	
limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;

 
 	•	 	
limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings;

 
 	•	 	
requiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our board of directors;

 
 	•	 	
controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of board and stockholder meetings; and

 
 	•	 	
providing the board of directors with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings.

These provisions, alone or together, could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control or changes in our management.
As a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock.
Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.
Our current agreements with Blackstar, an affiliate of Daimler, contain certain restrictions that decrease the likelihood that potential acquirers would make a bid to acquire us.
Our financing agreements with Blackstar, an affiliate of Daimler, include certain restrictions that decrease the likelihood that potential acquirers would make a bid to acquire us, including giving Blackstar a right of notice on any acquisition proposal we receive for which we determine to engage in further discussions with a potential acquiror or otherwise pursue. Blackstar then has a right, within a specified time period, to submit a competing acquisition proposal. In addition, Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect, Chairman and largest stockholder, has agreed that he will not transfer any shares of our capital stock beneficially owned by him to any automobile original equipment manufacturer, other than Daimler, without Blackstar’s consent. Mr. Musk
 
50
Table of Contents

has further agreed not to vote any shares of our capital stock beneficially owned by him in favor of a deemed liquidation transaction to which any automobile original equipment manufacturer, other than Daimler, is a party without Blackstar’s consent. These provisions could delay or prevent hostile takeovers and changes in control of us, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to fall.
Purchasers in this offering will experience immediate and substantial dilution in the book value of their investment.
The anticipated initial public offering price of our common stock is substantially higher than the net tangible book value per share of our outstanding common stock immediately after this offering. Therefore, if you purchase our common stock in this offering, you will incur immediate dilution of $             in the net tangible book value per share from the price you paid. In addition, following this offering, purchasers in the offering will have contributed     % of the total consideration paid by our stockholders to purchase shares of common stock, in exchange for acquiring approximately     % of our total outstanding shares as of September 30, 2009 after giving effect to this offering. The exercise of outstanding stock options will result in further dilution.
If securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us, our business or our market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely, our stock price and trading volume could decline.
The trading market for our common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.
Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the proceeds we receive in this offering and might not apply the proceeds in ways that increase the value of your investment.
Our management will have broad discretion over the use of our net proceeds from this offering, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these proceeds. Our management might not apply our net proceeds in ways that ultimately increase the value of your investment. We expect to use 50% of the net proceeds from this offering, up to a maximum of $100 million, to fund an equity proceeds account as required by our DOE Loan Facility with the remainder being used for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, which may in the future include investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, services or technologies. Our management might not be able to yield a significant return, if any, on any investment of these net proceeds. You will not have the opportunity to influence our decisions on how to use our net proceeds from this offering.
After the completion of this offering, we do not expect to declare any dividends in the foreseeable future.
After the completion of this offering, we do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. Consequently, investors may need to rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This prospectus, including the sections entitled “Prospectus Summary,” “Risk Factors,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and “Business” contains forward-looking statements. All statements other than statements of historical facts contained in this prospectus, including statements regarding our future results of operations and financial position, business strategy and plans and our objectives for future operations, are forward-looking statements. The words “believe,” “may,” “will,” “estimate,” “continue,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “expect” and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. We have based these forward looking statements largely on our current expectations and projections about future events and financial trends that we believe may affect our financial condition, results of operations, business strategy, short term and long-term business operations and objectives, and financial needs. These forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including those described in “Risk Factors.” Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risks emerge from time to time. It is not possible for our management to predict all risks, nor can we assess the impact of all factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements we may make. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward looking events and circumstances discussed in this prospectus may not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied in the forward looking statements.
You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, we cannot guarantee that the future results, levels of activity, performance or events and circumstances reflected in the forward-looking statements will be achieved or occur. Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this prospectus to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in our expectations.
You should read this prospectus and the documents that we reference in this prospectus and have filed with the SEC as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part with the understanding that our actual future results, levels of activity, performance and events and circumstances may be materially different from what we expect.

Unless otherwise indicated, information contained in this prospectus concerning our industry and the markets in which we operate, including our general expectations and market position, market opportunity and market size, is based on information from various sources, on assumptions that we have made that are based on those data and other similar sources and on our knowledge of the markets for our services. These data involve a number of assumptions and limitations, and you are cautioned not to give undue weight to such estimates. We have not independently verified any third party information and cannot assure you of its accuracy or completeness. While we believe the market position, market opportunity and market size information included in this prospectus is generally reliable, such information is inherently imprecise. In addition, projections, assumptions and estimates of our future performance and the future performance of the industry in which we operate is necessarily subject to a high degree of uncertainty and risk due to a variety of factors, including those described in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this prospectus. These and other factors could cause results to differ materially from those expressed in the estimates made by the independent parties and by us.

USE OF PROCEEDS
We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock that we are offering will be approximately $             million, assuming an initial public offering price of $             per share, which is the mid-point of the range reflected on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses that we must pay. Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $             per share, which is the midpoint of the range reflected on the cover page of this prospectus, would increase or decrease, as applicable, our cash and cash equivalents, working capital, total assets and total stockholders’ equity (deficit) by approximately $             million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares in this offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $            .
We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders, including any shares of common stock sold by the selling stockholders in connection with the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock, although we will bear the costs, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with the sale of these shares. The selling stockholders may include certain of our executive officers and members of our board of directors or entities affiliated with or controlled by them.
We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to fund planned capital expenditures, working capital and other general corporate purposes. We currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of between $100 million and $125 million during the year ended December 31, 2010. Such amounts include the $33 million of our anticipated powertrain and Model S manufacturing facility projects that will not be funded by advances under our loan facility with the United States Department of Energy, or DOE Loan Facility. We expect to use a portion of this offering to fund such amount. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to potentially expand our current business through acquisitions of complementary businesses, products or technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions at this time. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and subject to our obligations under our DOE Loan Facility, we will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds.
We have agreed to set aside 50% of the net proceeds from this offering, up to a maximum of $100 million, to fund a separate, dedicated account under our DOE Loan Facility. We will use amounts deposited into this account to pre-fund certain costs of our powertrain and Model S manufacturing facility projects, which would have otherwise been funded through advances made under the DOE Loan Facility, as well as to fund any cost overruns for these projects. These amounts are in addition to our obligation to fund $33 million of our anticipated powertrain and Model S manufacturing facility projects that will not be funded by advances under our DOE Loan Facility. Once the funds deposited into this dedicated account have been used in full, the pre-funded costs will be reimbursed to us through true-up advances under our DOE Loan Facility.
Pending use of the proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the proceeds in highly liquid cash equivalents that are permitted under our DOE Loan Facility or United States government securities.
Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our common stock and increase our visibility in the marketplace. A public market for our common stock will facilitate future access to public equity markets and enhance our ability to use our common stock as a means of attracting and retaining key employees and as consideration for acquisitions. Depending on the future demand for our products and the pace at which we expand our manufacturing capacity, we may seek to raise additional capital to fund our manufacturing expansion.

DIVIDEND POLICY
We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our common or preferred stock. We currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any future determination to declare cash dividends will be made at the discretion of our board of directors, subject to applicable laws and compliance with certain covenants under our loan facility with the United States Department of Energy, which restrict or limit our ability to pay dividends, and will depend on our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, general business conditions and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant.

DILUTION
As of September 30, 2009, we had a negative net tangible book value of approximately $             million or $             per share of common stock, based upon             shares of common stock outstanding on such date. Our pro forma net tangible book value as of September 30, 2009 was $             million, or $             per share of common stock. Pro forma net tangible book value per share represents the amount of our total tangible assets reduced by the amount of our total liabilities and divided by the total number of shares of common stock outstanding, including shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock effective immediately prior to the closing of this offering and the issuance of shares of common stock upon the assumed net exercise of warrants that would otherwise expire upon the completion of this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $             per share. The increase in the net tangible book value per share attributable to the conversion of our preferred stock and the net exercise of the warrants will, accordingly, be $             per share.
Dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share to new investors in this offering represents the difference between the amount per share paid by purchasers of             shares of common stock in this offering and the pro forma net tangible book value per             share of common stock immediately after the completion of this offering. After giving effect to the sale of the shares of common stock offered by us in this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $             per share, the mid-point of the range set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us, our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value as of September 30, 2009 would have been $             million, or $             per share of common stock. This represents an immediate increase in pro forma net tangible book value of $             per share to existing stockholders and an immediate dilution of $             per share to new investors in our common stock. The following table illustrates this dilution on a per share basis.

A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $             per share would increase or decrease our pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering by $             per share and the dilution in pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value to new investors by $             per share, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of our common stock in full, based on an assumed initial public offering price of $             per share, the pro forma as adjusted net tangible book value per share after this offering would be $             per share, and the dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per share to new investors in this offering would be $             per share.

The following table summarizes, on a pro forma as adjusted basis as of September 30, 2009 and after giving effect to (i) the issuance of              shares of common stock upon the net exercise of convertible preferred stock warrants that would otherwise expire upon the completion of this offering and (ii) the offering, in each case based on an assumed initial public offering price of $             per share, the differences between existing stockholders and new investors with respect to the number of shares of common stock purchased from us, the total consideration paid to us and the average price per share paid:

A $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of $             per share would increase or decrease, respectively, total consideration paid by new investors and total consideration paid by all stockholders by approximately $             million, assuming that the number of shares offered by us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same.
If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, our existing stockholders would own     % and our new investors would own     % of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding upon the closing of this offering.
As of September 30, 2009, there were options outstanding to purchase a total of 10,627,629 shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of $0.74 per share. To the extent outstanding options are exercised, there will be further dilution to new investors. For a description of our equity plans, see the section titled “Management—Employee Benefit Plans.”

(2)	In January 2010, we issued a warrant to the DOE in connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility to purchase shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock. This convertible preferred stock warrant will become a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock upon the closing of this offering. Beginning on December 15, 2018 and until December 14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the DOE Loan Facility during the prior quarter. Since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary, this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other income (expense), net, until its expiration or exercise. Potential common shares issuable upon exercise of the DOE warrant will be excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share of common stock until such time as we generate a net profit in a given period.
(3)	Our basic net loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares, excluding common shares subject to repurchase, and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of stock options to purchase common stock and warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock (using the treasury stock method) and the conversion of our convertible preferred stock and convertible notes payable (using the if-converted method). For purposes of these calculations, potential common shares have been excluded from the calculation of diluted net loss per share of common stock as their effect is antidilutive since we generated a net loss in each period.
(4)	Pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock has been computed to give effect to the conversion of the convertible preferred stock into common stock. Also, the numerator in the pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share calculation has been adjusted to remove gains and losses resulting from remeasurements of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability as it is assumed that these warrants will be exercised immediately prior to a qualifying initial public offering and will no longer require periodic revaluation.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION
AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS
The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this prospectus. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” or in other parts of this prospectus.
Overview
We design, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. In addition to designing and manufacturing our vehicles, we sell and service them through our own sales and service network.
We were incorporated in Delaware in 2003 and introduced our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, in early 2008. In July 2009, we introduced a new Roadster model, the Tesla Roadster 2, and its higher performance option package Roadster Sport. As of December 31, 2009, we had sold 937 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 18 countries. We are developing our planned Model S sedan which we currently expect to introduce in 2012.
We market and sell our vehicles directly to consumers via the phone and internet, in-person at our corporate events and through our network of Tesla stores. We opened our first store in Los Angeles, California, in May 2008 and as of December 31, 2009, we operated a total of 10 Tesla stores in North America and Europe.
We have entered, and intend to enter, into development and commercial agreements with other manufacturers for the development and sale of electric powertrain components. From inception through September 30, 2009, our powertrain development activities related exclusively to an agreement entered into in May 2009 with Daimler AG, or Daimler, for the development of a battery pack and charger for Daimler’s Smart fortwo electric drive. We have been selected by Daimler to supply it with up to 1,000 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive in five European cities. We began shipping the first of these battery packs and chargers in November 2009 and started to recognize revenue for these sales in the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
Since inception through September 30, 2009, we have recognized $108.2 million in revenue. As of September 30, 2009, we had an accumulated deficit of $236.4 million. We experienced net losses of $30.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, $78.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $82.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, and $31.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
Basis of Presentation
Automotive Sales
We recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle, or ZEV, credits. We did not recognize any revenue from sales of the Tesla Roadster, vehicle options, accessories or destination charges until the quarter ended December 31, 2008. To date, most of our revenues have been generated through sales in the United States. Our international sales commenced with the launch of the Tesla Roadster in Europe in July 2009. We had no revenues from sales outside of the United States prior to the third quarter of 2009 and revenue from sales outside of the United States represented 14% of our total automotive sales revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. As we continue to expand into new markets, we expect our international revenues to increase in aggregate

Table of Contents

dollar amounts and as a percentage of total revenues in future periods. We manage our business as a single geographic segment. While revenue related to servicing vehicles has been insignificant to date, we expect such revenues to increase in future periods as we sell more vehicles and as vehicle warranties begin to expire.
Starting in July 2006, we began taking reservations and collecting reservation payments from customers who wished to purchase a Tesla Roadster and we received a significant number of reservations prior to initiation of volume production of the Tesla Roadster in October 2008. Since that time, we have fulfilled a significant number of these reservations and a significant level of the automotive sales we recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 came from fulfilling reservations placed prior to 2009. Beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2009, we expect sales of the Tesla Roadster in each future quarter to more closely approximate orders placed in such future quarter than has been the case in prior periods.
As of December 31, 2008, we had deferred $3.6 million in revenue related to certain vehicles that had been delivered but as to which we had unfulfilled obligations related to powertrain upgrades. Although these vehicles performed to a level adequate for most driving conditions, we had promised our customers an upgrade of the powertrain. As a result, we deferred all revenue recognition of these Tesla Roadsters that we had delivered in 2008 until they were retrofitted with the new powertrain. We performed these upgrades and accordingly recognized the revenue for these vehicles beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 and concluding in the quarter ended September 30, 2009.
As of September 30, 2009, we had deferred $3.4 million in revenue related to sales of Tesla Roadsters that had been shipped, but had not been delivered to the customer as of the end of the period and the sale of certain vehicle options that had not yet been delivered. The majority of these deferred revenues were recognized as automotive sales during the quarter ended December 31, 2009. We expect our deferred revenues to fluctuate in future periods depending on the number of automobiles that have been shipped but have not been delivered to the customers by the end of the period.
We do not plan to sell our current generation Tesla Roadster after 2011 due to planned tooling changes at a supplier for the Tesla Roadster, and we do not currently plan to begin selling our next generation Tesla Roadster until at least one year after the launch of the Model S which is not expected to be in production until 2012. As a result, we anticipate that we may generate limited, if any, revenue from selling electric vehicles after 2011 until the launch of the planned Model S. The launch of our Model S could be delayed for a number of reasons and any such delays may be significant and would extend the period in which we would generate limited, if any, revenues from sales of our electric vehicles.
Under California’s Low-Emission Vehicle Regulations, and similar laws in other states, vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. Currently, the states of California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have such laws in effect. These laws provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we have earned ZEV credits on vehicles sold in such states, and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future.
We enter into contracts with third parties to sell ZEV credits generated from the sale of our Tesla Roadsters. We did not recognize revenue from sales of ZEV credits until June 2008. For the year ended December 31, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we earned revenue from the sale of ZEV credits of $3.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively. As sales of the Tesla Roadster increased during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, the ZEV credits we earned also increased.
We have entered into two contracts for the sale of ZEV credits. Our current agreement provides for the sale of the ZEV credits that we earn from the sale of vehicles that we manufactured between January 1, 2009 and
 
62
Table of Contents

December 31, 2009, and we have until June 30, 2010 to sell these credits under the agreement. We are currently negotiating to extend this agreement for vehicles manufactured in 2010 and 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we had sold credits for 340 vehicles under this agreement. We previously had an agreement with a different purchaser for our ZEV credits earned during the year ended December 31, 2008.
Our ZEV credit sales will depend on the status of future regulation in states in which we sell our vehicles and our ability to maintain a contract or portfolio of contracts that allow us to continue to sell ZEV credits. To the extent that we have a contract in place for selling the credits, we expect sales of ZEV credits to generally correlate with our vehicle sales, although there is a processing time lag of generally less than four to five weeks between the recognition of revenue from the sale of a vehicle and the recognition of revenue from the sale of the ZEV credit earned on that vehicle.
Powertrain Sales
We intend to sell electric vehicle powertrain components to other manufacturers, although we have not recognized any revenues from powertrain sales through September 30, 2009.
We have been selected by Daimler to supply it with up to 1,000 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive in five European cities. We began shipping the first of these battery packs and chargers in November 2009 and started to recognize revenue for these sales in the quarter ended December 31, 2009. We intend to grow our powertrain sales revenue over time by establishing additional commercial arrangements with Daimler and other automobile manufacturers.
Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead, including amortized tooling costs, royalty fees, shipping and logistic costs and reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of sales also includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. We also recognize charges through cost of sales to provide for non-cancellable purchase orders for inventory deemed to be obsolete or in excess of net realizable value. Costs related to sales of powertrain components which we began to deliver to Daimler during the quarter ended December 31, 2009, are included within costs of sales.
We define our gross profit as our automotive sales and powertrain sales less our cost of sales and our gross margin as our gross profit expressed as a percentage of automotive sales and powertrain sales.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for our teams in engineering and research, supply chain, quality, manufacturing engineering and manufacturing test organizations, prototyping expense, contract and professional services and amortized equipment expense. We have invested heavily in research and development for the Tesla Roadster and to a lesser extent to date, for the Model S. We have also invested in critical components of our electric powertrain technology including the battery system, power electronics module, motor, charging system, software and gearbox. We expense research and development costs as incurred.
Prior to our recognition of any revenue from sales of the Tesla Roadster beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2008, expenses related to excess and obsolete inventory and certain other manufacturing production costs were charged to research and development expenses. Since we began recognizing revenue from the production and sale of the Tesla Roadster, we have recorded these costs as cost of sales.
 
63
Table of Contents

Since the commercial launch of the Tesla Roadster, our investment in related research and development has decreased significantly. We are, however, in the process of significantly increasing our research and development efforts for the Model S, which will result in a significant increase in our research and development expenses in both aggregate dollar amounts and as a percentage of our revenues in future periods.
We have entered, and intend to enter, into development and sales agreements with manufacturers for the development and sale of electric powertrain components. Compensation received from these manufacturers to fund our development activities are recognized as an offset against our related research and development expenses. From inception through September 30, 2009, our powertrain development activities have been under a development arrangement entered into in the year ended December 31, 2008, which was formalized in an agreement entered into with Daimler in May 2009 for the development of a battery pack and charger for Daimler’s Smart fortwo electric drive.
We began receiving payments under this development arrangement with Daimler in the year ended December 31, 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities in such year. We deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time. Upon entering into the final agreement in May 2009, we began recognizing the deferred development compensation as an offset to our research and development expenses in an amount of $14.5 million on a straight-line basis. This amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement, beginning in May 2009 and continuing through November 2009. Payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in May 2009, were recognized upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones. The milestone payments contemplated in the agreement were commensurate with the effort involved to overcome the technological challenges of achieving the milestones. All amounts received under this development agreement are being recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. As of September 30, 2009, we had deferred development compensation in the amount of $4.2 million related to the development agreement and have received another $1.9 million from milestone payments related to development efforts performed after this date. As of December 31, 2009, all development work related to the development agreement had been completed, and we expect that the full $23.2 million under the development agreement will be recognized in the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
As of December 31, 2009, we had 191 employees working in research and development.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and facilities costs related to our Tesla stores, marketing, sales, executive, finance, human resources, litigation settlements, information technology and legal organizations, as well as fees for professional and contract services.
We expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase both in aggregate dollar amounts and as a percentage of revenue in future periods as we continue to grow and expand our operations, increase our sales and marketing team to handle our expanding customer base and market presence, and as we transition to becoming a public company. We also expect an increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses as a result of our planned increase in the number of Tesla stores. As of December 31, 2009, we had opened 10 Tesla stores in the United States and Europe. We plan to nearly double the number of Tesla stores opened by the end of 2010, with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within the next several years.
As of December 31, 2009, we had 181 employees working in selling, general and administrative functions.

Interest Income
Interest income consists of interest earned on cash balances and short-term investments. We have historically invested our available cash balances in money market funds, short-term United States Treasury obligations and commercial paper.
Interest Expense
Interest expense consists of interest on outstanding convertible debt and other borrowings. In future periods, we expect our interest expense to also include interest on our borrowings under our loan facility from the United States Department of Energy, or DOE Loan Facility. As a result, we expect interest expense to increase significantly in aggregate dollar amounts and, prior to the launch of the Model S, as a percentage of revenues.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net consists primarily of the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrants liability and transaction gains and losses on our foreign currency-denominated assets and liabilities. We expect our transaction gains and losses will vary depending upon movements in the underlying exchange rates. We also expect the charges resulting from the change in the fair value of our convertible preferred stock warrant liability to be eliminated following this offering as a result of our expectation that the warrants currently outstanding to purchase 650,882 shares of our Series C convertible preferred stock and 866,091 shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock will either be exercised or expire upon the completion of this offering, at which time the convertible preferred stock warrant liability will no longer exist. However, in January 2010, we issued a warrant to the DOE in connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock. This preferred stock warrant will become a warrant to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our common stock upon the closing of this offering. Beginning on December 15, 2018 and until December 14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the DOE Loan Facility during the prior quarter. Since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary, this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other income (expense), net, until its expiration or exercise.
Provision for Income Taxes
We are subject to income taxes in the countries where we sell our products. Historically, we have primarily been subject to taxation in the United States because we have sold the majority of our products to customers in the United States. We anticipate that in the future as we expand our sale of products to customers outside the United States, we would become subject to taxation based on the foreign statutory rates in the countries where these sales took place and our effective tax rate could fluctuate accordingly.
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
We believe that based on the available information, it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized, and accordingly we have taken a full valuation allowance against all of our United States deferred tax assets. As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $183 million of federal and $161 million of California operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024 for federal and 2019 for state purposes if unused. Additionally, we had research and development tax credits of approximately $3.9 million and $3.7 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development carry-forwards will expire in various
 
65
Table of Contents

amounts beginning in 2019. However, the state credits can be carried forward indefinitely. Federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that ownership changes occurred in 2004 and 2006 due to significant stock transactions. Currently, we do not expect the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards to be materially affected as no significant limitations are expected to be placed on these carry-forwards as a result of our previous ownership changes. We have not yet, however, determined whether this offering would constitute an ownership change resulting in limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. If an ownership change is deemed to have occurred as a result of this offering, utilization of these assets could be significantly reduced.
Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
In connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2007, our independent registered public accounting firm had identified material weaknesses in our internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended and as of December 31, 2007 were as follows:
 
 	•	 	
We did not maintain adequate controls to ensure the accuracy, completeness and safeguarding of spreadsheets used in our financial reporting process. Specifically, we maintained many supporting financial schedules on a manual and non-integrated spreadsheet basis, which increased the risk of compiling inaccurate or incomplete information.

 
 	•	 	
We did not maintain effective controls over cut-off procedures for expenses. Specifically, we did not have formal cut-off procedures in place to ensure the timely and accurate recording of accruals.

Our remediation efforts for these material weaknesses have included:
 
 	•	 	
an increased level of spreadsheet maintenance and review, as well as continuing exploration of automation opportunities;

 
 	•	 	
expanded cross-functional involvement and input into period end expense accruals, as well as process improvements in the procure-to-pay cycle and analytics in establishing certain cost center accruals; and

 
 	•	 	
increased reporting capabilities from our financial and enterprise resource planning systems to monitor and track financial reporting.

We plan to continue to assess our internal controls and procedures and intend to take further action as necessary or appropriate to address any other matters we identify.
No material weaknesses were identified in connection with the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2008.
To date, the audit of our consolidated financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm has included a consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis of designing their audit procedures, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. If such an evaluation had been performed or when we are required to perform such an evaluation, additional material weaknesses and other control deficiencies may have been or may be identified.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures. We base our estimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows will be affected. We believe that the following critical accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.
Automotive Sales
We recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle options, accessories and destination charges, vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle, or ZEV, credits. We recognize revenue when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.
Automotive sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sale of vehicles. Sales or other amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheets. While we have recently arranged for financing options on our vehicles in the United States through a third-party lender, we do not provide direct financing for the purchase of the Tesla Roadster to our customers and we are therefore generally paid in full by the customer at the time of purchase.
Automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the sales of vehicle options, accessories and destination charges. While these sales may take place separately from a vehicle sale, they are often part of one vehicle sale agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements. Contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of our revenue, including whether the deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting, and, if so, how the price should be allocated among the elements, when to recognize revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue should be recognized. We are also required to evaluate whether a delivered item has value on a stand-alone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items. Further, we assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items, determined by reference to stand-alone sales of such items.
To date, we have been able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles, vehicle accessories and options separately, outside of any multiple element arrangements. As each of these items has stand alone value to the customer, revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer. Increased complexity to our sales agreements or changes in our judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue recognized in future periods.
Powertrain Development
We began receiving payments under a development arrangement with Daimler in the year ended December 31, 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities. We deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant
 
67
Table of Contents

contractual terms were not in place prior to that time. Upon entering into the final agreement in May 2009, we began recognizing the deferred development compensation as an offset to our research and development expenses on a straight-line basis. This amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement, beginning in May 2009 and continuing through November 2009. Payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in May 2009 were recognized upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones. All amounts received under this development agreement are being recognized as an offset to our research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations.
Inventory Valuation
We value our inventories at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand forecasts. If our inventory on hand is in excess of our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written off.
We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to convert inventory on hand into a finished product.
Prior to commencement of sales of the Tesla Roadster in the quarter ended December 31, 2008, we recorded inventory write-downs as a component of research and development expenses. Upon commercial introduction of the Tesla Roadster, we recorded these write-downs as a component of cost of sales. Once inventory is written-down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded write-downs of $0.8 million to research and development expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded write-downs of $3.7 million to research and development expenses and $0.6 million to cost of sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we recorded write-downs of $2.5 million to cost of sales.
The inventory amounts are based on our current estimates of demand, selling prices and production costs. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, material changes to these reserves may be required. Further, a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.
Adverse Purchase Commitments
To the extent future inventory purchases under non-cancellable purchase orders or agreements are for excess or obsolete parts or the related inventory is deemed to be in excess of its net realizable value, we record a provision for adverse purchase commitments. The charges recorded prior to commencement of recognition of automotive sales of the Tesla Roadster in the quarter ended December 31, 2008, were recorded as research and development expenses. Once we began recognizing revenue from vehicle sales, we began recording these charges as a component of cost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded charges of $1.5 million to research and development expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded charges of $1.0 million to research and development expenses and $0.4 million to cost of sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we recorded charges of $0.8 million to cost of sales.
The amounts we record are based on our current estimates of demand, selling prices and production costs. Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, material changes to these reserves may be required. Further, a small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.

Warranties
We accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle is delivered to a customer. Warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data. We review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Initial warranty data can be limited early in the launch of a new vehicle and accordingly, the adjustments that we record may be material. As of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, we had $0.9 million and $4.3 million in warranty reserves, respectively. Adjustments to warranty reserves are recorded in cost of sales.
It is likely that as we sell additional Tesla Roadsters we will acquire additional information on the projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty and may need to make additional adjustments. Further, a small change in our warranty estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial results.
We began selling powertrain components and recognizing such sales during the quarter ended December 31, 2009. As a result, we began accruing warranty reserves for these products. As with our warranty reserves for automotive sales, we intend to review our powertrain warranty reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and will adjust our estimates as needed.
Valuation of Stock-Based Awards, Common Stock and Warrants
Stock-Based Compensation
Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for our stock options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method. The intrinsic value method requires a company to recognize compensation expense for stock options granted to employees based on any differences between the exercise price of the stock options granted and the fair value of the underlying common stock. Under the intrinsic value method, any compensation cost relating to stock options was recorded on the date of the grant in stockholders’ equity as deferred compensation and was thereafter amortized to expense over the vesting period of the grant. We generally did not recognize stock-based compensation for stock options granted to our employees prior to January 1, 2006 as we granted stock options with an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock.
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for our stock options granted to employees which requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for the stock options, based on the grant date fair value of the award. The fair value of the awards is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The resulting cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, usually the vesting period which is generally four years.
We adopted the fair value method using the prospective transition method as we used the minimum value method for the previously required pro forma disclosures. The prospective transition method requires us to continue to apply the intrinsic value method in future periods to equity awards outstanding as of January 1, 2006. Under the prospective transition method, any compensation costs that will be recognized from January 1, 2006 will include only: (a) compensation cost for all stock-based awards granted prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, based on the intrinsic value method; and (b) compensation cost for all stock-based awards granted or modified subsequent to December 31, 2005, net of estimated forfeitures, based on fair value. We amortize the fair value of our stock-based compensation for the equity awards granted after January 1, 2006 on a straight-line basis, which we believe better reflects the level of service to be provided by our employees over the vesting period of the awards. In accordance with the prospective transition method, results for prior periods were not restated.

Beginning on January 1, 2006, the fair value of each new employee option awarded was estimated on the grant date for the periods below using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions.

If in the future we determine that another method for calculating the fair value of our stock options is more reasonable, or if another method for calculating the above input assumptions is prescribed by authoritative guidance, the fair value calculated for our employee stock options could change significantly.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and expected volatility. Further, the forfeiture rate also affects the amount of aggregate compensation. These inputs are subjective and generally require significant judgment.
The risk-free interest rate that we use is based on the United States Treasury yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon United States Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. Given our limited history with employee grants, we use the “simplified” method in estimating the expected term for our employee grants. The “simplified” method, as permitted by the SEC, is calculated as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.
Our expected volatility is derived from the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries related to our business, including the automotive OEM, automotive retail, automotive parts and battery technology industries, because we have no trading history on our common stock. When making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility calculation, we also considered the stage of development, size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies. Our historical volatility is weighted based on certain qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior and other factors. Quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant effect on reported stock-based compensation expense, as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. If a revised forfeiture rate is higher than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in a decrease to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. If a revised forfeiture rate is lower than the previously estimated forfeiture rate, an adjustment is made that will result in an increase to the stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The effect of forfeiture adjustments during 2006, 2007 and 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was insignificant.
As we accumulate additional employee option data over time and as we incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate significantly different volatilities, expected lives and forfeiture rates, which could materially impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation expense is recorded in our cost of sales, research and development expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses.
We recorded stock-based compensation of $0.4 million during both the year ended December 31, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009. As of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, we had $1.0

million and $2.1 million of unrecognized stock-based compensation costs, respectively, which is expected to be recognized over an average period of 3.2 and 3.0 years, respectively and of which we expect to amortize $0.5 million during the year ending December 31, 2010. In future periods, our stock-based compensation expense is expected to increase materially as a result of our existing unrecognized stock-based compensation and as we issue additional stock-based awards to continue to attract and retain employees and nonemployee directors.
We account for stock options issued to nonemployees also based on their estimated fair value determined using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. However, the fair value of the equity awards granted to nonemployees is re-measured as the awards vest, and the resulting increase in value, if any, is recognized as expense during the period the related services are rendered.
Common Stock Valuation
We have historically granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair value of our common stock as determined at the date of grant by our Board of Directors. Because there has been no public market for our common stock, our Board of Directors has determined the fair value of our common stock by considering a number of objective and subjective factors, including the following:
 
 	•	 	
our sales of preferred stock to unrelated third parties;

 
 	•	 	
our operating and financial performance;

 
 	•	 	
the lack of liquidity of our capital stock;

 
 	•	 	
trends in our industry;

 
 	•	 	
arm’s length, third-party sales of our stock; and

 
 	•	 	
contemporaneous valuations performed by an unrelated third-party.

There is inherent uncertainty in these estimates and if we had made different assumptions than those used, the amount of our stock-based compensation expense, net loss and net loss per share amounts could have been significantly different. The following table summarizes, by grant date, the number of stock options granted since January 1, 2008 and the associated per share exercise price, which equaled the fair value of our common stock for each of these grants.

Included in the December 4, 2009 awards, were 20,135,920 stock options granted to our Chief Executive Officer comprised of two grants.

base as of December 4, 2009, or 10,067,960 stock options, with  1/4th of the shares vesting immediately, and  1/48th of the shares scheduled to vest each month over the subsequent three years, assuming continued employment through each vesting date. In addition, to create incentives for the attainment of clear performance objectives around a key element of our current business plan—the successful launch and commercialization of the Model S—the Board of Directors approved additional options totaling an additional 4% of our fully-diluted shares as of December 4, 2009, with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of performance objectives as follows, assuming Mr. Musk’s continued service to us through each vesting date:
 
 	•	 	
 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the successful completion of the Model S Engineering Prototype;

 
 	•	 	
 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the successful completion of the Model S Vehicle Prototype;

 
 	•	 	
 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the completion of the first Model S Production Vehicle; and

 
 	•	 	
 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the completion of 10,000th Model S Production Vehicle.

If Mr. Musk does not meet one or more of the above milestones prior to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, he will forfeit his right to the unvested portion of the grant.
Our Board of Directors has performed valuations of our common stock for purposes of granting stock options in a manner consistent with the methods outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The enterprise value input of our common stock valuations were derived either using fundamental analysis (income and market approaches) or based on a recent round of financing (option pricing approach). The income approach estimates the enterprise value of the company by discounting the expected future cash flows of the company to present value. We have applied discount rates that reflect the risks associated with our cash flow projections and have used venture capital rates of return for companies at a similar stage of development as us, as a proxy for our cost of capital. Our discounted cash flow calculations are sensitive to highly subjective assumptions that we were required to make at each valuation date relating to appropriate discount rates for various components of our business. For example, the discount rates used to value the cash flow projections from the Model S business factored in the low cost debt we expected to raise from the U.S. Department of Energy.

Our projected cash flows have been primarily derived from our Tesla Roadster, Model S and powertrain revenue streams. These cash flow projections take into account the fact that we have been selling the Tesla Roadster since 2008, that we began selling powertrain components in the quarter ended December 31, 2009 and our anticipation of Model S production in 2012.
Under the market approach, the total enterprise value of the company is estimated by comparing our business to similar businesses whose securities are actively traded in public markets, or businesses that are
 
72
Table of Contents

involved in a public or private transaction. Prior transactions in our stock are also considered as part of the market approach methodology. We have selected revenue valuation multiples derived from trading multiples of public companies that participate in the automotive OEM, automotive retail, and automotive parts and battery technology industries. These valuation multiples were then applied to the equivalent financial metric of our business, giving consideration to differences between our company and similar companies for such factors as company size and growth prospects.
For those reports that relied on the fundamental analysis, we prepared a financial forecast to be used in the computation of the enterprise value for both the market approach and the income approach. The financial forecasts took into account our past experience and future expectations. The risks associated with achieving these forecasts were assessed in selecting the appropriate discount rate. As discussed below, there is inherent uncertainty in these estimates. Second, we allocated the resulting equity value among the securities that comprise our capital structure using the Option-Pricing Method. The aggregate value of the common stock derived from the Option-Pricing Method was then divided by the number of common shares outstanding to arrive at the per share common value. For those reports that relied on the recent round of financing, we back-solved for the total equity value such that the value of the instrument sold in the recent round as calculated by the option pricing model is consistent with the observed transaction price.
Our Board of Directors has considered the valuations derived from the approaches above, the probability and timing of completing an initial public offering, as well as other qualitative factors in arriving at our common stock valuations, including the following:
 
 	•	 	
significant operating losses for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008;

 
 	•	 	
flat revenue growth trends in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2008 as a result of global macroeconomic uncertainty;

 
 	•	 	
the absence of a significant initial public offering market throughout 2008 and continuing through the second quarter of 2009; and

 
 	•	 	
other market developments that influence forecasted revenue.

Valuations that we have performed require significant use of estimates and assumptions, If different estimates and assumptions had been used, our common stock valuations could be significantly different and related stock-based compensation expense may be materially impacted.
Warrants
We have accounted for our freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities at fair value upon issuance. We have recorded the warrants as liabilities because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock were contingently redeemable and, therefore, may have obligated us to transfer assets at some point in the future. The warrants were subject to re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value was recognized as a component of other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations. We estimated the fair value of these warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model which used several assumptions that are subject to significant management judgment as is the case for stock-based compensation as discussed above. Upon the completion of this offering, we expect that the convertible preferred stock warrants currently outstanding will either be exercised or become warrants to purchase shares of our common stock. Accordingly, at that time we expect that the convertible preferred stock warrant liability will no longer exist. However, in January 2010, we issued a warrant to the DOE in connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility to purchase shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock. This convertible preferred stock warrant will become a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock upon the closing of this offering. Beginning on December 15, 2018 and until December 14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the DOE Loan Facility during the prior quarter. Since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary, this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other income (expense), net, until its expiration or exercise.

Income Taxes
We record our provision for (benefit from) income taxes in our consolidated statements of operations by estimating our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. We estimate our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences arising from differing treatment of items recognized for financial reporting versus tax return purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets, which are included in our consolidated balance sheets. In general, deferred tax assets represent future tax benefits to be received when certain expenses previously recognized in our consolidated statements of operations become deductible expenses under applicable income tax laws, or loss or credit carryforwards are utilized. Valuation allowances are recorded when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We make these estimates and judgments about our future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our future plans. As of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, we had recorded a full valuation allowance on our U.S. net deferred tax assets because we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized in the foreseeable future. Should the actual amounts differ from our estimates, the amount of our valuation allowance could be materially impacted.
Furthermore, significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax settlement is uncertain. As a result, we recognize the effect of this uncertainty on our tax attributes, such as net operating losses, based on our estimates of the eventual outcome. These effects are recognized when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. We are required to file income tax returns in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, which requires us to interpret the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in such jurisdictions. Such returns are subject to audit by the various federal, state and foreign taxing authorities, who may disagree with respect to our tax positions. We believe that our accounting consideration is adequate for all open audit years based on our assessment of many factors, including past experience and interpretations of tax law. We review and update our estimates in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, the lapse of a statute of limitations or a material change in estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters differs from our expectations, such differences may impact income tax expense in the period in which such determination is made. The eventual impact on our income tax expense depends in part if we still have a valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets in the period that such determination is made.

Comparison of the Nine Month Periods Ended September 30, 2008 and 2009
Automotive Sales
To date, most of our revenues have been generated through sales in the United States. We had no revenues from sales outside of the United States prior to the third quarter of 2009 and revenue from sales outside of the United States represented 14% of our total revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Our international sales commenced with the launch of the Tesla Roadster in Europe in July 2009.
Automotive sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 in the amount of $0.6 million were derived primarily from the sale of ZEV credits. ZEV credit sales increased from $0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 to $7.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Although we did not recognize revenue from the sale of Tesla Roadsters during the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we generated ZEV credits from the delivery of vehicles during such period which we sold to a third party automobile manufacturer. As sales of the Tesla Roadster increased during the nine month period ended September 30, 2009, sales of ZEV credits also increased.
Substantially all of the increase in automotive sales to $93.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was due to sales of the Tesla Roadster. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2009, we recognized revenue related to the sale of 706 Tesla Roadsters. A significant portion of the revenue recognized during this period came from fulfilling reservations placed prior to 2009.
 
75
Table of Contents

As of September 30, 2009, we had deferred revenue from automotive sales in the amount of $3.4 million compared to $4.1 million as of December 31, 2008. Deferred revenue as of September 30, 2009 was mostly derived from Tesla Roadster sales where vehicles had been shipped, but had not been delivered to the customer as of the end of the period. During the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we delivered 32 Tesla Roadsters to customers for which we had unfulfilled obligations related to powertrain upgrades. Although these vehicles performed to a level adequate for most driving conditions, we had promised our customers an upgrade of the powertrain. As a result, we deferred all revenue recognition of these Tesla Roadsters that we had delivered in 2008 until they were retrofitted with the new powertrain. We performed these upgrades and accordingly recognized the revenue for these vehicles beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 and concluding in the quarter ended September 30, 2009.
Cost of Sales and Gross Profit
Cost of sales increased from $19,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 to $85.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Substantially all of the cost of sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 consisted of cost related to sales of Tesla-branded merchandise. Substantially all of the cost of sales during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 was due to the costs related to the sales of the Tesla Roadster from which we began to recognize revenue during the quarter ended December 31, 2008. This significant increase in cost of sales was due to the corresponding increase in our automotive sales on a period over period basis. Due to the model changeover from the Tesla Roadster to the Tesla Roadster 2 as well as significant part changes implemented to improve the design and reduce per unit costs, we recorded charges to cost of sales in the amount of $0.7 million for excess and obsolete inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we generated a gross profit of $0.6 million. Substantially all of the gross profit was generated by the sale of ZEV credits during the nine months ended September 30, 2008. During this period, we had minimal cost of sales as we were not yet recognizing revenue from the sale of Tesla Roadsters. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009 we recognized gross profit of $7.8 million and a gross margin of 8.3%.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses decreased from $41.9 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 to $11.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The $30.7 million decrease in research and development expenses was a result of development compensation we recognized from Daimler in the amount of $17.1 million which offset $17.1 million of research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, as well as a net decrease in research and development expenses of $13.6 million. The $13.6 million decrease in research and development expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 consisted primarily of a $10.0 million decrease resulting from the allocation of various manufacturing-related costs to inventory and cost of sales once we transitioned into commercial production, a $4.2 million decrease in charges related to excess and obsolescence, adverse purchase commitments and materials and tooling expense due both to the classification of production-related costs in cost of sales as well as lower engineering and development activity, a $2.5 million decrease in consulting and other professional services following the substantial completion of development of the Tesla Roadster, partially offset by a $2.7 million increase in employee compensation expenses associated with higher headcount for the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
We began receiving payments under a development arrangement with Daimler in the year ended December 31, 2008 to compensate us for the cost of our development activities. We deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time. Upon entering into the final agreement in May 2009, we began recognizing, as an offset to our research and development expenses, the deferred development compensation of $14.5 million on a straight-line basis. This amount was recognized over the expected life of the

agreement, beginning in May 2009 and continuing through November 2009. Payments that we received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to contract execution in May 2009, were recognized, as an offset to our research and development expenses, upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones.
We did not recognize any development compensation from Daimler during the nine months ended September 30, 2008.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $14.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 to $25.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The $11.6 million increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses during the nine month period ended September 30, 2009 consisted primarily of a $4.9 million increase in employee compensation expenses, including a $3.0 million increase related to higher sales and marketing headcount to support our opening of additional stores in the United States and Europe, a $2.2 million increase in costs principally related to events showcasing the Model S, a $2.2 million increase in office information technology and facilities costs to support the growth of our business, and a $1.5 million increase in legal services and legal settlements and accounting and other consulting services to support our growth.
Interest Income
Interest income decreased from $0.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 to $0.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The $0.4 million decrease in our interest income during the nine month period ended September 30, 2009 was a result of our receiving higher returns on our cash and short-term investment balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2008, partially offset by higher average balances during the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased from $2.6 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 to $2.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Interest expense for both periods was related to our convertible notes which converted into shares of our Series E convertible preferred stock in May 2009.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net which consisted of income during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 in the amount of $0.2 million decreased by $0.5 million to an expense in the amount of $0.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2009. This change was a result of a $0.9 million increase in the fair value of the outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared to a $0.4 million increase during the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
Provision (Benefit) for Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes increased from a provision of $73,000 during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 to a benefit for income taxes in the amount of $0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 as a result of recognition of research and development credits during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 from our foreign operations.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2007 and 2008
Automotive Sales
During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008, all of our automotive sales were from shipments to locations within the United States. Automotive sales during the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted entirely
 
77
Table of Contents

of sales of Tesla-branded merchandise as we did not recognize any revenue from the sales of our Tesla Roadster. We did not recognize revenue from sales of ZEV credits in the year ended December 31, 2007 as we had not yet earned any credits through deliveries of the Tesla Roadster. As we began delivering the Tesla Roadster to customers during the year ended December 31, 2008, we also began selling ZEV credits associated with these deliveries. For the year ended December 31, 2008, we earned $3.5 million from the sale of ZEV credits. Substantially all of the increase in automotive sales to $14.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to sales of the Tesla Roadster for which we began to recognize revenue in the quarter ended December 31, 2008. Almost all of the revenue recognized during this period, came from fulfilling reservations placed in prior periods.
As of December 31, 2008, we had deferred $3.6 million in revenue related to certain vehicles that had been delivered but as to which we had unfulfilled obligations related to powertrain upgrades. Although these vehicles performed to a level adequate for most driving conditions, we had promised our customers an upgrade of the powertrain. As a result, we deferred all revenue recognition of these Tesla Roadsters that we had delivered in 2008 until they were retrofitted with the new powertrain. We performed these upgrades and accordingly recognized the revenue for these vehicles beginning in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 and concluding in the quarter ended September 30, 2009. We had no deferred revenue as of December 31, 2007.
Cost of Sales and Gross Profit (Loss)
Cost of sales increased from $9,000 during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $15.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. All of the cost of sales during the year ended December 31, 2007 consisted of cost related to sales of Tesla-branded merchandise. Substantially all of the cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 was due to the costs related to the sales of the Tesla Roadster which commenced during the quarter ended December 31, 2008.
During the year ended December 31, 2008, we had a gross loss of $1.1 million due to the lower pricing for our initial vehicles, the high materials and manufacturing costs associated with our first generation Tesla Roadster and limited economies of scale from low vehicle production volumes. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we had a gross profit of $64,000 from sales of our Tesla branded merchandise.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses decreased from $62.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $53.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The $9.0 million decrease in our research and development expenses was due to a $10.2 million decrease in development-related contract services expenses due primarily to the significant contractor and other resources required in 2007 to drive completion of Tesla Roadster development, a $4.4 million decrease in professional services driven by significant engineering activities on the powertrain and vehicle to facilitate the start of production, partially offset by a $3.7 million increase in tooling and material expenses, including costs related to obsolete inventory and adverse purchase commitments, and a $2.8 million increase in office expenses and allocated information technology and facilities costs to support our research and development activities.
Prior to the commercialization of the Tesla Roadster, expenses related to excess and obsolete inventory and certain other costs were charged to research and development expenses. Once we began recognizing revenue from the production and sales of the Tesla Roadster in the quarter ended December 31, 2008, we began recording these costs in cost of sales.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $17.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $23.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The $6.4 million increase in our
 
78
Table of Contents

selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2008 consisted primarily of a $3.6 million increase in legal services and legal settlements and, accounting and other consulting services, a $1.3 million increase associated with higher head count expenses and a $1.0 million increase in marketing expenses to support our growth.
Interest Income
Interest income decreased from $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007 to $0.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2008. The $1.2 million decrease in our interest income during the year ended December 31, 2008 was a result of our receiving lower interest rates on invested cash during the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, as well as higher average cash balances during the year ended December 31, 2007.
Interest Expense
Interest expense increased to $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to no interest expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2008 was primarily a result of interest on our outstanding convertible notes issued early in the year and which remained outstanding throughout the remainder of the year.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2007 in the amount of $0.1 million changed by $1.1 million to an expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. A majority of this change was a result of a $2.8 million increase in the fair value of the outstanding convertible preferred stock warrants during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to a small decrease during the year ended December 31, 2007. This expense for the year ended December 31, 2008 was partially offset, among other things, by a $1.2 million gain on the cancellation of warrants in connection with the issuance and conversion of certain convertible notes in that period.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes was $0.1 million during both years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008. In both periods, these expenses related primarily to foreign income taxes.
Comparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2006 and 2007
Automotive Sales
We recorded our first revenue during the year ended December 31, 2007 which was derived entirely from the online sale of Tesla-branded merchandise after the launch of our Tesla online store in December 2007.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales of $9,000 during the year ended December 31, 2007 related to online merchandise sales. We had no cost of sales in the year ended December 31, 2006.
Research and Development Expenses
Research and development expenses increased from $25.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 to $62.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The $37.8 million increase in our research and development expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 was due primarily to increases in professional

Table of Contents

services and contract labor fees of $15.4 million as we employed several consulting firms and numerous contractors to assist in and accelerate our research and development efforts, an increase in research and development employees as we continued to build our core team of electric vehicle scientists and engineers, resulting in an increase in employee compensation expenses of $12.5 million, and an increase of $3.0 million in tooling and material expenses associated with changing vendors for the body panels of the Tesla Roadster as well as write-downs of inventories and charges related to adverse purchase commitments.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased from $5.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 to $17.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The $11.8 million increase in our selling, general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to a $4.4 million increase in legal, accounting, information technology and other professional fees and expenses, an increase in employee compensation expenses in the amount of $3.2 million, including an increase of $2.1 million related to increased sales and marketing personnel, a $1.3 million increase in depreciation primarily related to increased office furniture and equipment and computer equipment and software, and a $0.8 million increase in contract services fees.
Interest Income
Interest income increased from $0.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 to $1.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2007. The $0.8 million increase in our interest income during the year ended December 31, 2007 was a result of our receiving higher returns on our cash equivalent and investment balances during the year.
Interest Expense
Interest expense decreased from $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to no interest expense recognized during the year ended December 31, 2007. Interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily a result of convertible notes issued in March 2006, which converted to convertible preferred stock in June 2006.
Other Income (Expense), Net
Other income (expense), net was $0.1 million during both years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007.
Provision for Income Taxes
Our provision for income taxes was $0.1 million during both years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of September 30, 2009, our principal sources of liquidity were our cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $106.5 million which are invested in money market funds. Our primary source of cash historically has been proceeds from the sales of convertible preferred stock, sales of convertible notes, refundable reservation payments from customers for the Tesla Roadster and more recently from sales of the Tesla Roadster, our compensation for electric powertrain development and refundable reservation payments for our Model S. Through September 30, 2009, we had raised an aggregate of $319.2 million from sales of convertible preferred stock and convertible note financings. Since inception through the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we had accumulated net operating losses of $236.4 million.
On January 20, 2010, we entered into our DOE Loan Facility for $465.0 million to support the expansion of our manufacturing operations. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $101.2 million will be made available
 
80
Table of Contents

under the first term loan facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding for the build out of a facility to design and manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and electric components, or the Powertrain facility. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $363.9 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding for the development of, and to build out the manufacturing facility for, our Model S sedan, or the Model S facility. Under the DOE Loan facility, we are responsible for the remaining 20% of the costs eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the projects as well as any cost overruns for each project. The costs paid by us to date for the Powertrain facility and the Model S facility will be applied towards our obligation to contribute 20% of the eligible project costs, and the DOE’s funding of future eligible costs will be adjusted to take this into account. Our remaining obligations for these projects are budgeted to be an aggregate of $33 million, plus any cost overruns for the projects.
Our ability to draw down funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions. For the Powertrain facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain manufacturing facility and the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. For the Model S facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the Model S and the planned Model S manufacturing facility, including an environmental assessment of such facility approved by the DOE. Certain advances will be subject to additional conditions to drawdown related to the site on which the applicable project is located.
Advances under the DOE Loan Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the date of the advance and will be based on the Treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal installments for such advance. Interest on advances under the DOE Loan Facility is payable quarterly in arrears.
Under the DOE Loan Facility, we have committed to pay all costs and expenses incurred to complete the projects being financed in excess of amounts funded under the loan facility. We will be required to maintain, at all times, available cash and cash equivalents of at least 105% of the amounts required to fund such commitment, after taking into account current cash flows and cash on hand, including cash on hand raised in this offering, and reasonable projections of future generation of net cash from operations, losses and expenditures. Loans may be requested under the facilities until January 22, 2013, and we have committed to complete the projects being financed prior to such date. On the closing date, we paid a facility fee to the DOE in the amount of $0.5 million. We intend to receive the first drawdown under each facility starting in the first quarter of 2010.
The DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among others, a requirement that the projects be conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the ATVM Program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business, and enter into certain restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities, and (i) through December 15, 2012, a minimum cash balance, and (ii) after December 15, 2012, a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a limit on capital expenditures and, after March 31, 2014, a maximum ratio of total liabilities to shareholder equity.
Under the DOE Loan Facility, we are required to fund a debt service reserve account on or before December 31, 2012, in an amount equal to all principal and interest that will come due on the advances on the next two payment dates. Once we have deposited such two payments, we will not be required to further fund such debt service reserve account. We have also agreed that, in connection with the sale of our common stock in this offering, at least 75% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us and, in connection with the sale of
 
81
Table of Contents

our stock in any other follow-on equity offering, at least 50% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us. Offering proceeds may not be used to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers, directors, employees or consultants in excess of the amounts contemplated by our business plan approved by the DOE.
In addition to our obligation to fund a portion of the project costs as described above, we have agreed to set aside 50% of the net proceeds from this offering and any subsequent offerings of stock occurring before the completion of the projects, up to an aggregate of $100 million, to fund a separate, dedicated account under our DOE Loan Facility. We will use amounts deposited into this dedicated account to fund project costs of the Powertrain facility and the Model S facility which would have otherwise been funded through advances made under the DOE Loan Facility such that, while there are funds available in the dedicated account, for each dollar of project costs advanced under the DOE Loan Facility, one dollar of project costs that would otherwise have been funded under the DOE Loan Facility will be funded from the dedicated account. The dedicated account can also be used by us to fund any cost overruns for these projects. Once the funds deposited into this dedicated account have been used in full, we will be reimbursed by the drawdown of additional funds for amounts paid from this account, and we will be required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account in an amount equal to up to 30% of the remaining project costs for the applicable project. These amounts will similarly be used to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the drawdown of additional funds once used in full.
We expect that the proceeds of this offering and the loans under the DOE Loan Facility, together with our anticipated cash from operating activities and cash on hand, will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next 24 months. In order to fund our operations beyond that time, we may need to raise additional funds through the issuance of equity, equity-related or debt securities or through obtaining credit from government or financial institutions. This capital will be necessary to fund our ongoing operations, continue research, development and design efforts, establish sales and service branches, improve infrastructure such as expanded battery assembly facilities, and introduce new vehicles such as the Model S. We cannot be certain that additional funds will be available to us on favorable terms when required, or at all.
Capital Expenditures
During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008, we used $6.5 million, $9.8 million and $9.6 million in cash, respectively, to fund capital expenditures. During the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2009, we used $9.5 million and $5.7 million in cash, respectively, to fund capital expenditures. We currently anticipate making aggregate capital expenditures of between $100 million and $125 million during the year ending December 31, 2010, primarily related to the development of the Model S.

Cash Flows from Operating Activities
We continue to experience negative cash flows from operations as we expand our business and build our infrastructure both in the United States and internationally. Our cash flows from operating activities are significantly affected by our cash investments to support the growth of our business in areas such as research and development and selling, general and administrative. Our operating cash flows are also affected by our working capital needs to support growth and fluctuations in inventory, personnel related expenditures, accounts payable and other current assets and liabilities.
 
82
Table of Contents

A component of our cash flows from operations has been our receipt of refundable reservation payments from our customers. Refundable reservation payments consist of reservation and membership payments that allow potential customers to hold a reservation for the future purchase of a Tesla Roadster or Model S. In the United States, we accept reservations for our Tesla Roadster with a $9,900 reservation payment and for the Model S with a minimum $5,000 reservation payment. In the United States, approximately three months prior to production of a Tesla Roadster, we require the customer to make full payment of the balance owed on the vehicle to lock in a production slot. These fees are used by us to fund, in part, our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand. Our current reservation agreement for the Tesla Roadster provides that prior to locking in the production slot for the Tesla Roadster, reservation payments are refundable, less a cancellation fee of $250. After locking in the production slot, the reservation payments are not refundable. For the Model S, our current reservation agreements provide for a $50 cancellation fee until the customer selects options. Upon selection of options, the customer will make an additional reservation payment, following which the cancellation fee becomes $10,000. Reservation payments for a vehicle are recorded as a current liability when received. No later than upon the delivery of a vehicle, the reservation payments collected on a customer’s account are applied against the total purchase price of the vehicle. Refundable reservation payments are expected to fluctuate as the number of reservation holders on the Tesla Roadster reservation list decreases, while the number of reservation holders on the Model S reservation list increases.
Net cash used in operating activities was $30.1 million and $51.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2009. The largest component of our cash used during both periods was the $57.3 million net loss incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2008, which included non-cash charges of $2.9 million related to depreciation and amortization and $2.5 million related to interest on convertible notes, and the $31.5 million net loss incurred in the nine months ended September 30, 2009, which included non-cash charges of $5.0 million related to depreciation and amortization and $2.7 million related to interest on convertible notes, and a non-cash gain of $1.5 million from the extinguishment of convertible notes and warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Cash used in operating activities period over period was also impacted by a $20.8 million increase in refundable reservation payments held by us as of September 30, 2008 compared to a $23.2 million decrease in refundable reservation payments held by us as of September 30, 2009. The decrease in the refundable reservation payments was due to the launch of the Tesla Roadster during the nine months ended September 30, 2008. This is because we began delivering the Tesla Roadster to customers and applying the related reservation payments to the respective customers’ purchase cost. Also, additional fluctuations in our cash flows from operating activities resulted from multiple changes in other working capital accounts including a $3.3 million increase in deferred revenue, a $0.6 million increase in deferred development compensation and a $11.5 million increase in inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared to a $6.0 million decrease in deferred development compensation, and only a $3.0 million increase in inventory during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The decrease in deferred development compensation was mostly the result of the amortization of this deferred development compensation through the consolidated statement of operations during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, partially offset by the payments received under the development arrangement with Daimler during the period. The larger increase in inventory reflected our build up of inventory in 2008 in anticipation of the commercial introduction of the Tesla Roadster.
Net cash used in operating activities was $53.5 million and $52.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008. The largest component of our cash used during both years, was the $78.2 million net loss incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007, which included non-cash charges of $2.9 million related to depreciation and amortization and a $2.4 million loss on abandonment of certain fixed assets, and the $82.8 million net loss incurred during the year ended December 31, 2008, which included non-cash charges of $4.2 million related to depreciation and amortization, $3.7 million related to interest on convertible notes and $2.8 million related to the fair value change in our convertible preferred stock warrant liability. The fluctuations in cash flows from operating activities as a result of changes in working capital accounts included a $15.2 million increase in refundable reservation payments received, a $8.1 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities, and a $2.1 million increase in inventory during the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to a $10.7 million increase in refundable reservation payments received, a $10.2 million increase in deferred

development compensation, a $11.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a $4.1 million increase in deferred revenue, partially offset by a $14.5 million increase in inventory during the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase in refundable reservation payments during the year ended December 31, 2008 was lower than the increase in the prior year as we began delivering the Tesla Roadster to customers and applying the related reservation payments to the respective customers’ purchase cost. The increase in deferred development compensation is mostly the result of collections under the development agreement with Daimler prior to December 31, 2008 which were deferred entirely until we entered into a final agreement in May 2009 compared to no such agreements or collections during the year ended December 31, 2007. The higher increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the prior year was due to the growth in our business. The larger increase in inventory during the year ended December 31, 2008 reflected our build up of inventory in anticipation of the commercial introduction of the Tesla Roadster.
Net cash used in operating activities was $3.4 million and $53.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007. The $50.0 million increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily attributable to the $30.0 million net loss incurred during the year ended December 31, 2006, which included non-cash charges of $0.6 million related to depreciation and amortization and $0.4 million related to interest on convertible notes, and the $78.2 million net loss incurred during the year ended December 31, 2007, which included non-cash charges of $2.9 million related to depreciation and amortization and a $2.4 million loss on abandonment of certain fixed assets. The fluctuations in cash flows from operating activities as a result of changes in working capital accounts included a $4.4 million increase in accrued liabilities and accounts payable and a $22.1 million increase in refundable reservation payments received and no changes to inventory during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a $8.1 million increase in accrued liabilities and accounts payable, a $15.2 million increase in refundable reservation payments received and a $2.1 million increase in inventory during the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase in accrued liabilities and accounts payable was a result of changes in the scope of our operations.
Cash Flows from Investing Activities
We continue to experience negative cash flows from investing activities as we expand our business and build our infrastructure both in the United States and internationally. Cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to capital expenditures to support our growth in operations as well as restricted cash that we must maintain in relation to lease agreements, equipment financing, and certain vendor credit policies.
Net cash used in investing activities was $9.4 million and $8.0 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2009. The uses of cash for investing activities during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 were substantially all related to purchases of capital equipment while uses during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 consisted of $5.7 million as a result of purchases of capital equipment and $2.4 million related to increases in restricted cash primarily relating to standard credit policies required by our online payment vendors.
Net cash used in investing activities was $9.8 million and $10.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2008. There was only a small decrease in the amount of $0.2 million in cash used for purchases of capital equipment during the year ended December 31, 2008 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, however, restricted cash increased by $1.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to a $40,000 decrease during the year ended December 31, 2007.
Net cash used in investing activities was $6.8 million and $9.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2007. The year over year increase was due to a $3.3 million increase in cash used for purchases of capital equipment during the year ended December 31, 2007 when compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, however, restricted cash increased by $0.3 million during the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to a $40,000 decrease during the year ended December 31, 2007.

Net cash used in investing activities is expected to increase substantially as we build out and tool our Model S manufacturing facility, and our powertrain manufacturing facility in Palo Alto, California. We expect our capital expenditures to be between $100 million and $125 million in the year ending December 31, 2010.
Cash Flows from Financing Activities
We have financed our operations primarily with proceeds from issuances of convertible preferred stock and convertible notes, which provided us with aggregate net proceeds of $296.8 million on a cumulative basis for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
Cash provided by financing activities increased by $116.8 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2009 due to the issuance of $82.4 million in Series F convertible preferred stock and $49.4 million in Series E convertible preferred stock during the nine months ended September 30, 2009, and the issuance of convertible promissory notes in the amount of approximately $40.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2008 compared to $25.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
Cash provided by financing activities increased by $10.0 million from the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008. The increase was due almost entirely to the difference between the $54.8 million raised through the issuance of convertible notes during the year ended December 31, 2008 and the $44.9 million raised through the issuance of the Series D convertible preferred stock during the year ended December 31, 2007.
Cash provided by financing activities increased by $5.2 million from the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was due mostly to the difference between the $44.9 million raised through the issuance of the Series D convertible preferred stock during the year ended December 31, 2007 and the $36.8 million raised through the issuance of the Series C convertible preferred stock and the $3.0 million raised through the issuance of convertible notes during the year ended December 31, 2006.

(1)	Obligations include agreements or purchase orders to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and where the significant terms are specified. Where a minimum purchase obligation is stipulated, as in the case of our supply agreement with Lotus Cars Limited, the amounts included in the table reflect the minimum purchase amounts based on the December 31, 2008 exchange rate for the British Pound. Purchase obligations that are cancelable without significant penalty, are not included in the table.
(2)	
Long-term debt includes the outstanding convertible notes payable that are due on December 31, 2010 unless earlier converted according to the terms of the respective notes agreements. In February and March 2009, the Company issued additional convertible notes in the amounts of $25.5 million. These convertible notes accrued interest at a rate of 10% per annum. In May 2009, we converted these notes, including

accrued interest of $6.1 million, into shares of convertible preferred stock. As of September 30, 2009, the Company had no convertible notes outstanding. The convertible note issuances that occurred during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 and the conversion of all outstanding convertible notes during the same period are not reflected in the table above.
As of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, the Company held refundable reservation payments of $48.0 million and $24.8 million from potential customers, respectively, which are not reflected in the table above. In order to convert the refundable reservation payment into revenue, the Company will need to sell vehicles to these customers. Amounts related to the DOE Loan Facility are not reflected in the table above.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
During the periods presented, we did not have relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.
Impact of Inflation
We believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 or 2008 or the nine months ended September 30, 2009. There can be no assurance that future inflation will not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition.
Disclosure about Market Risk
Foreign Currency Risk
A portion of our costs and expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 were denominated in foreign currencies such as the British Pound and the Euro. This is primarily due to the contract with Lotus Cars Limited, or Lotus, in the United Kingdom to manufacture the Tesla Roadster vehicles and gliders and other parts sourced in Europe. Our international sales and marketing operations incur expense denominated in foreign currencies. This cost exposure is partially offset by our recent growth in sales in Europe, specifically the United Kingdom, with the launch of the Tesla Roadster in Europe in the quarter ended September 30, 2009 since payments for these vehicles are in Euros or British pounds. This provides a partial natural hedge to our cost exposure in Europe which can vary depending on our sales in Europe. Our battery cell purchases from Asian suppliers are also subject to currency risk. Although our present contracts are United States dollar based, if the United States dollar continues to depreciate significantly against the local currency, it could cause our Asian suppliers to significantly raise their prices, which could harm our financial results. To date, the foreign currency effect on our cash and cash equivalents has not been significant.
Interest Rate Risk
We had cash and cash equivalents totaling $106.5 million as of September 30, 2009. These amounts were invested in money market funds. The cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes. We believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents. Declines in interest rates, however, would reduce future investment income.
As of September 30, 2009, we did not have any debt or notes outstanding in which fluctuations in the interest rates would impact us as even our capital lease obligations are fixed rate instruments and are not subject to fluctuations in interest rates. There were convertible notes outstanding as of December 31, 2008, however, these convertible notes were converted into shares of convertible preferred stock in May 2009. We also expect to
 
86
Table of Contents

receive proceeds from loans under our DOE Loan Facility which will bear interest at a per annum rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the date of the loan, based on the Treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal installments for such loan.
Segment Information
We have determined that we operate in one reporting segment which is the design, manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles.
Waitlist and Reservations
Potential customers may reserve slots in our production schedule by entering into a reservation agreement and paying a refundable reservation payment. If the prospective customer decides to purchase a vehicle, the reservation payment can be used toward the purchase of a vehicle. We consider the reservation list as an indication of potential demand rather than a product backlog for pending vehicle sales, as customers on the customer reservation list have not made firm commitments to order and take deliveries of vehicles and may cancel such reservations at any time.
Starting in July 2006, we began taking reservations and collecting reservation payments from customers interested in purchasing a Tesla Roadster and we received a significant number of reservations prior to initiation of volume production of the Tesla Roadster in October 2008. Since that time, we have fulfilled a significant number of these reservations and a significant level of the automotive sales we recognized during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 came from fulfilling reservations placed prior to 2009. Beginning with the quarter ended December 31, 2009, we expect sales of the Tesla Roadster in each future quarter to more closely approximate orders placed in such future quarter than has been the case in prior periods.
As of December 31, 2009, we had accepted approximately 2,000 refundable reservations for the Model S sedans.
Seasonality
We expect sales of the Tesla Roadster to fluctuate on a seasonal basis with increased sales during the spring and summer months in our second and third fiscal quarters relative to our fourth and first fiscal quarters. However our limited operations history makes it difficult for us to judge the exact nature or extent of the seasonality of our business. We note that in general automotive sales tend to decline over the winter season and we anticipate that our sales of the Model S and other models we introduce may be similarly impacted. We do not expect our powertrain sales to be impacted to a significant extent by seasonality.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, which identifies the ASC as the authoritative source of generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. We adopted the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance for the interim reporting period ended September 30, 2009. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of the standard until the first quarter of 2009 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. The standard does not require any new fair value

measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. In April 2009, the FASB issued further guidance for estimating fair value when the level of market activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased, which is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. This standard is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring transparency about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in an entity’s financial statements; clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments and related hedged items; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect its financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which requires the recognition of both the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features. Under the standard, the debt component is required to be recognized at the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have an associated equity component. The equity component is recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt instrument and the fair value of the straight debt liability. The separation of the equity component creates a debt discount which is required to be accreted over the expected life of the debt. Retrospective application to all periods presented is required. This standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2009. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are considered participating securities for the purposes of calculating earnings per share. The standard clarified that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common stockholders, and therefore, are considered participating securities. The two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share would have to be applied. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2008. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which establishes the general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The standard, which includes a new requirement to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events, is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires companies to allocate revenue in multiple-element arrangements based on an element’s estimated selling price if vendor-specific or other third-party evidence of value is not available. The guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2011 with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating both the timing and the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.

BUSINESS
Industry Overview
We believe that more than 100 years after the invention of the internal combustion engine, incumbent automobile manufacturers are at a crossroads and face significant industry-wide challenges. The reliance on the gasoline-powered internal combustion engine as the principal automobile powertrain technology has raised environmental concerns, created dependence among industrialized and developing nations on oil largely imported from foreign nations and exposed consumers to volatile fuel prices. In addition, we believe the legacy investments made by incumbent automobile manufacturers in manufacturing and technology related to the internal combustion engine have to date inhibited rapid innovation in alternative fuel powertrain technologies. We believe these challenges offer an historic opportunity for companies with innovative electric powertrain technologies and that are unencumbered with legacy investments in the internal combustion engine to lead the next technological era of the automotive industry.
Growth in Demand for Electric Vehicles
We believe that the electrification of the automobile powertrain system is the most important innovation in modern automotive history. Electric propulsion offers the potential for improved performance and efficiency, and helps address many concerns related to the use of the internal combustion engine. We believe many consumers are increasingly willing to consider buying electric-based vehicles due to the environmental, economic and national security consequences of using gasoline-powered vehicles. As a result, we believe the market for electric vehicles is poised for significant growth as consumers continue to shift their preferences strongly toward more fuel efficient and lower emission vehicles.
We also believe government regulations and incentives are accelerating the growth of the electric vehicle market. Many governments in countries throughout the world are regulating vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards and offering incentives to consumers to purchase more energy efficient vehicles. For example, in 2009, the United States government enacted a $2.4 billion electric vehicle stimulus package with the goal of putting one million electric drive vehicles on the road by 2015. The United States government also recently increased fuel economy standards and offers consumer tax credits of up to $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. In Europe, the European Union recently passed stricter vehicle emissions standards, several countries have instituted direct subsidies and significant tax exemptions for electric vehicles, and some cities exempt electric vehicles from congestion charges. In Asia, the Chinese government offers subsidies of up to approximately $8,800 per electric vehicle.
We believe shifting consumer preferences together with government regulation and incentives will result in significant growth in the market for electric vehicles. According to Frost & Sullivan, a business research and consulting firm, the market for electric-based vehicles, which includes electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, is expected to grow to approximately 10.6 million units worldwide, or approximately 14% of new vehicles sold by 2015 from approximately 1.75 million units or 3% of new vehicles sold in 2008.
Incumbent Automobile Manufacturers Face Significant Challenges as They Pursue the Electric Vehicle Opportunity
We believe incumbent automobile manufacturers face significant challenges that will continue to inhibit their ability to capitalize on the electric vehicle opportunity. These challenges include:
 
 	•	 	
Dependence on the Internal Combustion Engine. We believe many incumbent automobile manufacturers to date have failed to aggressively pursue alternative fuel vehicle programs because of their continued need to invest in internal combustion engine technologies that support their existing revenue base and core competencies. We believe incumbent automobile manufacturers have to date addressed shifting consumer preferences and stricter regulatory emissions and energy efficiency

Table of Contents

 	
standards primarily by making incremental improvements to the internal combustion engine rather than by investing heavily in alternative fuel powertrain technologies. We believe incumbent automobile manufacturers will continue to focus on the internal combustion engine for the foreseeable future.
 
 	•	 	
Limited Electric Powertrain Expertise. To date, incumbent automobile manufacturers have pursued multiple alternative fuel programs, including hydrogen fuel cell, hybrid and electric powertrain technologies. We believe that exploring such a diverse range of programs while simultaneously continuing to invest in the internal combustion engine has diluted their efforts to commercially develop a specific alternative fuel powertrain technology. In addition, in many instances they have outsourced critical components of the alternative fuel powertrain and vehicle system design to third parties. As a result, we believe incumbent automobile manufacturers currently have relatively limited electric powertrain expertise, especially with respect to sophisticated battery cooling, power, safety and management systems.

 
 	•	 	
Profitability Pressures and Reduced Operating Flexibility. Many incumbent automobile manufacturers have recently faced deteriorating margins and liquidity, which we believe has significantly reduced their operating flexibility. Falling demand for internal combustion engine vehicles in recent periods, excess industry capacity, and shifting customer preferences toward smaller, more fuel efficient vehicles have reduced the gross margins and profitability at many incumbent automobile manufacturers. The resulting decline in profits at many incumbent automobile manufacturers has constrained their liquid capital resources. Moreover, incumbent automobile manufacturers generally rely on dealer franchises for sales and service, which requires them to share profits from vehicle sales, parts, and services. We believe these financial constraints of many incumbent automobile manufacturers will continue to limit their ability to invest in programs that they may not view as their core business.

 
 	•	 	
Long and Expensive New Product Development Process. New product launches by incumbent automobile manufacturers from development to production are often lengthy and require significant capital investments. We believe the development process for an electric vehicle program could be particularly difficult for incumbent automobile manufacturers given their need to develop an entirely new powertrain and the sophisticated battery cooling, power, safety and management systems necessary to support such a program. For example, the development of the Toyota Prius and its hybrid powertrain took an estimated $1 billion and over four years and the continuing development of the Chevrolet Volt hybrid has been estimated to cost $750 million.

Challenges That Have Limited Consumers’ Adoption of Electric Vehicles
Despite the automobile industry’s challenges, incumbent automobile manufacturers have attempted over time to respond to shifting consumer desires and government mandates by incorporating limited elements of electric propulsion into their vehicles. However, we believe that due to their traditional focus on supporting and extending their existing internal combustion engine vehicle programs and their relatively limited electric powertrain expertise, incumbent automobile manufacturers have to date been unable to design and offer a commercially successful electric vehicle. Many challenges have slowed electric vehicle adoption to date, including:
 
 	•	 	
Compromised Vehicle Design and Performance at a High Cost. Electric vehicles have historically incorporated battery cell chemistries such as lead acid, nickel cadmium, or nickel metal hydride that are expensive, bulky, and heavy per energy unit delivered, or per kilowatt-hour. We believe these cost, size, and weight constraints have restricted vehicle design, performance, functionality, and engineering, and have reduced the market appeal of these vehicles. For example, the size and efficiency constraints of General Motors’ EV1 battery limited the model to two seats and unconventional styling. Given these limitations, relatively few electric vehicles have been produced by the incumbent automobile manufacturers to date, and those that have been introduced are generally heavy and uneconomical, which we believe has restricted their appeal.

 	•	 	
Limited Vehicle Driving Range and Inconvenient Recharging Technology. To date, incumbent automobile manufacturers have been unable to commercially produce an electric vehicle with a claimed range in excess of 140 miles, and most vehicles introduced by incumbent automobile manufacturers have had effective ranges of 100 miles or less. Moreover, the absence of flexible charging capabilities onboard these vehicles has necessitated custom charging infrastructures or considerable recharging times, or both. We believe inconvenient charging options combined with range limitations have exacerbated consumers’ concerns with electric vehicles running out of power and the impracticalities of recharging these vehicles. We believe this “range anxiety” has undermined consumers’ views on the convenience and utility of electric vehicles and has significantly impacted demand for such vehicles.

Transitioning to Electric Vehicles
Incumbent automobile manufacturers have generally avoided introducing electric vehicles, focusing instead on incorporating electric propulsion into their vehicles through hybrid electric product lines. Although hybrid electric vehicles address some of the concerns associated with the historical reliance on the internal combustion engine, we believe they are a transitional technology between internal combustion engine vehicles and fully electric vehicles. The increased complexity and weight of the dual powertrain system inherent in hybrid and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles result in a less energy efficient vehicle, and as a result, these vehicles do not realize the full benefits of electric propulsion. Hybrid electric vehicles also require gasoline to run and produce emissions. Consequently, many hybrid electric vehicles have mile per gallon ratings that are only somewhat better than their internal combustion engine counterparts, while generally having limited performance. We believe that despite their limitations, the increasing popularity of hybrid electric vehicles demonstrates consumers’ desire for vehicles that can offer a solution to the concerns associated with the historical reliance on the internal combustion engine.
We believe incumbent automobile manufacturers have focused on hybrid electric vehicles in part because battery technology had not historically advanced to the point where it could provide consumers with an electric vehicle that has compelling range and performance. However, lithium-ion battery cells have improved in the last several years to provide higher energy density, or more energy per kilogram, at a lower cost per energy unit than competing battery cell chemistries. As a result, we believe that lithium-ion battery chemistry has now progressed to the point where it offers the opportunity to store enough energy to provide an electric vehicle with sufficient range and performance in many vehicle types to attract significant numbers of customers. Although storage characteristics of lithium-ion battery cell chemistries have improved, harnessing this energy into an electric vehicle requires an automobile manufacturer to develop sophisticated battery cooling, power, safety and management systems that have not been the focus of incumbent automobile manufacturers. Consequently, to date incumbent automobile manufacturers have not commercially mass produced vehicles with electric powertrain technology.
As a result of the focus by the incumbent automobile manufacturers on the internal combustion engine, the financial pressures they face and the technical hurdles to developing an electric vehicle program, we believe there is currently a significant opportunity for a new entrant that has an innovative electric powertrain technology and a business model unencumbered by the legacy challenges facing incumbent automobile manufacturers to be a leader in the global electric vehicle market.
Our Solution
We design, manufacture and sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. We own our sales and service network and have operationally structured our business in a manner that we believe will enable us to rapidly develop and launch advanced electric vehicles and technologies. We believe our vehicles and operational structure differentiates us from incumbent automobile manufacturers.

We are the first and currently only company to commercially produce a federally-compliant electric vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, which achieves a market-leading range on a single charge combined with attractive design, driving performance and zero tailpipe emissions. We have accomplished this in our Tesla Roadster, a vehicle that offers impressive acceleration and performance without producing any tailpipe emissions. The foundation of our business is our proprietary electric vehicle powertrain system that has enabled us to produce the Tesla Roadster and will also form the basis for our Model S sedan which is currently scheduled to begin production in 2012. In addition, we are expanding the sale of our electric powertrain components to other automotive manufacturers as evidenced by the start of the sale of our battery packs and chargers to Daimler AG, or Daimler, beginning in November 2009.
We sell and service our Tesla Roadster though our company-owned sales and service network, and intend to do the same for our planned future vehicles. We believe the feedback and data we collect from our sales and service operations, combined with our product design based on common platforms and software based controls of our powertrain, will enable us to rapidly and cost effectively introduce and improve our products. We believe that this approach provides us with a competitive advantage as compared to incumbent automobile manufacturers.
Our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. The recently introduced Roadster Sport version can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.7 seconds. The Tesla Roadster has a range of 236 miles on a single charge, as determined by an independent third party using the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s, or EPA’s, combined two-cycle city/highway test. Recently, the EPA announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. The Tesla Roadster has a range that is almost double that of any other commercially released electric vehicle and reportedly set a new world distance record of 313 miles for a production electric car in a rally across Australia as part of the 2009 Global Green Challenge. The current effective price of the base configuration of the Tesla Roadster is $101,500 in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. The Tesla Roadster is currently in production, and as of December 31, 2009, we had sold 937 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 18 countries, almost all of which were sold in the United States and Europe. As of December 31, 2009, our customers had driven the Tesla Roadster for an estimated 3.0 million miles. We have developed extensive software systems to manage the overall efficiency, safety and controls within our vehicles. Additionally, we have met battery shipping and testing protocols of the United Nations, United States Department of Transportation and other government agencies, allowing us to ship the Tesla Roadster to a number of countries throughout the world.
We announced our second electric vehicle, the Model S, with the public reveal of a drivable early prototype in March 2009. We currently plan to begin production of the Model S in 2012. We are designing a highly functional, four-door sedan which seats five adults and has attractive styling. As a fully electric vehicle, the Model S will produce zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of under 6 seconds. We currently anticipate introducing the base Model S at an effective price of $49,900 in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even without the tax credit, we believe the base list price will be competitive from a pricing perspective with other premium sedans. We are designing the Model S to offer a variety of range options from 160 miles to 300 miles on a single charge, as projected using the EPA’s combined two-cycle city/highway test. The EPA has announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. We also plan to offer the capability to fast charge in as little as forty-five minutes at commercial charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future and to rapidly swap out its battery pack at a specialized commercial battery exchange facility to complement its range capabilities. We believe that the Model S will demonstrate our ability to produce increasingly affordable electric vehicles that offer long range capabilities and uncompromised performance, energy efficiency, convenience and design.

We are designing the Model S for a significantly broader customer base than the Tesla Roadster. Accordingly, we currently intend to target an annual production rate of up to approximately 20,000 cars per year. The drivable early prototype of the Model S was revealed to the public in March 2009 and as of December 31, 2009, approximately 2,000 customers reserved and paid a refundable reservation payment of at least $5,000 for the purchase of the Model S. We have entered into our loan facility from the United States Department of Energy, or DOE Loan Facility, for a $465.0 million loan, $363.9 million of which is intended for the continued development of the Model S and the build out of our planned Model S manufacturing facility.

Tesla Roadster	  	Tesla Model S
The electric powertrain we developed for the Tesla Roadster has provided the foundational technology for our planned Model S and for electric powertrain components that we have begun selling to Daimler. Our electric powertrain consists of only three physical components: our modular battery pack, our power electronics module and our motor. This component design contains far fewer moving parts than a gasoline powertrain. These features enable us to adapt it for a variety of vehicle applications. The Tesla Roadster electric powertrain will be the basis of the Model S powertrain, with design enhancements. Similarly, using the existing Tesla Roadster battery pack, we have worked with Daimler since June 2008 to develop a battery pack and charging system for an initial trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive vehicle pilot program in five European cities. We intend to expand this business by developing and selling additional powertrain components to Daimler and other third party OEMs, and have secured $101.2 million of an aggregate $465.0 million from our DOE Loan Facility to fund the infrastructure for this business. We believe that our development efforts in our powertrain business will enable us to advance our technology and rapidly and cost effectively develop vehicles.
Our battery pack and electric powertrain system has enabled us to deliver market-leading range capability on the Tesla Roadster at what we believe is a compelling battery cost per kilowatt-hour. The battery pack of the Tesla Roadster uses commercially available lithium-ion battery cells and contains 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing its range capability. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, customized motor design, and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. These technology innovations have resulted in an extensive intellectual property portfolio.
We are designing our vehicles to enable the cost effective development of our future vehicles. First, our battery pack is based on commodity battery cells placed in modules that we believe will form the basis of later generations of our battery packs, such as those we are developing for the Model S and the Smart fortwo electric drive. Second, we use upgradeable software extensively for managing vehicle performance and the driver experience. Finally, we are designing a common platform architecture for the Model S, which compactly positions the battery pack, motor and other elements of our powertrain within the frame of the vehicle. We

believe this architecture will form the basis of several future vehicles and enable us to efficiently and cost-effectively launch new vehicle models in the future.
Our design capabilities and the technical advancements of our powertrain system have enabled us to design and develop zero tailpipe emission vehicles that we believe overcome the design, styling, and performance issues that we believe have historically limited broad consumer adoption of electric vehicles. As a result, we believe our Tesla Roadster customers enjoy, and Model S customers will enjoy, several benefits, including:
 
 	•	 	
Long Range and Recharging Flexibility. The range of the Tesla Roadster is almost double the range of any other commercially available electric vehicle. We are designing the Model S to offer an even greater range option. In addition, the Tesla Roadster incorporates our proprietary on-board charging system, permitting recharging from almost any available electrical outlet, and we are designing the Model S to offer fast charging capability from higher power electrical outlets. We believe the long range and charging flexibility of our vehicles will help reduce consumer anxiety over range, alleviate the need for expensive, large-scale charging infrastructure, and differentiate our vehicles as compared to our competitors’ currently announced electric vehicle product offerings.

 
 	•	 	
Energy Efficiency and Cost of Ownership. We believe our Tesla Roadster offers and our planned Model S will offer consumers an attractive cost of ownership when compared to similar internal combustion engine or hybrid electric vehicles. Using only a single electric powertrain enables us to create a lighter, more energy efficient vehicle that is mechanically simpler than currently available hybrid or internal combustion engine vehicles. For example, assuming a 236 mile range of the Tesla Roadster, an average electricity cost of 11.0 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price of $2.61 per gallon, which were the average electricity cost and gasoline price in the United States, respectively, as of December 31, 2009, the cost per mile to fuel the Tesla Roadster is approximately 75% less than the cost to fuel the 2009 Porsche 911 Carrera, which has an EPA mileage rating of 18 miles per gallon city and 25 miles per gallon highway. Furthermore, we expect our electric vehicles will have lower relative maintenance costs than hybrid, plug-in hybrid, or internal combustion engine vehicles due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs, and engine valves. Additionally, government incentives that are currently available can reduce the cost of ownership even further.

 
 	•	 	
High-Performance Without Compromised Design or Functionality. We believe we have been able to successfully overcome the design and performance tradeoff issues that encumbered most early electric vehicle designs. We believe the Tesla Roadster delivers an unparalleled driving experience with instantaneous and sustained acceleration through an extended range of speed. In addition, our planned Model S is being designed to seat five adults, provide best in class storage in the trunk and hood while offering design and performance comparable to, or better than, other premium sedans.

Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following combination of capabilities and features of our business model distinguish us from our competitors and position us well to capitalize on the expected growth in the electric vehicle market:
 
 	•	 	
Singular Focus and Leadership in Electric Powertrain Technology. With the introduction of the Tesla Roadster, we believe we demonstrated that performance, range, and efficiency can be achieved at an attractive energy cost per mile without compromising vehicle styling and the overall driving experience. We have spent over five years developing and optimizing our proprietary electric powertrain technology and its interaction with vehicle systems to achieve this compelling combination of range and performance. We have expertise in electrical engineering, thermal management, battery system design, battery cell testing and evaluation and electric vehicle safety and durability, as well as in the software systems and controls that govern the entire electric powertrain system. We are focused

exclusively on developing our electric powertrain technology and, unlike many incumbent automobile manufacturers, we do not have to allocate financial and operational resources to support legacy investments in the internal combustion engine.
 
 	•	 	
Combination of Expertise from Silicon Valley and the Traditional Automotive Industry. Our roots in Silicon Valley have enabled us to recruit engineers with strong skills in electrical engineering, software, and controls, and are further complemented by other members of our team with significant automotive expertise in vehicle engineering and manufacturing. Accordingly, we believe our team of engineers and managers combines the culture of innovation, rapid product development and flexible processes of leading technology companies with the operational experience of leading automotive companies.

 
 	•	 	
Proprietary Systems Integration of Vehicle and Electric Powertrain. The commercial production of a highway capable, fully electric vehicle that meets consumers’ range and performance expectations required substantial design, engineering, and integration work on almost every system of our Tesla Roadster. We designed several vehicle systems, including the body, chassis, heating and cooling, low voltage electrics, power electronics, and software specifically for our Tesla Roadster. For example, controlling and managing the components of our powertrain to make driving an electric vehicle feel intuitive and responsive to driver demands required substantial software development. As a result, we believe we have developed significant vehicle engineering and integration expertise. Our ability to combine expertise in electric powertrain and vehicle engineering provides a broad capability in electric vehicle design and systems integration.

 
 	•	 	
Rapid Customer Focused Product Development. We have designed our vehicles and business to quickly capture customer feedback and channel it to product development. We have also designed our product development process to use such data and customer feedback to rapidly introduce new features and designs. Our vehicles log usability data as soon as a customer begins driving, and we collect and supplement it with feedback from our company-owned sales and service operations. Since the performance of our electric powertrain is governed by control software, we believe we can quickly fine-tune our vehicles in response to this data. For example, within nine months of the Tesla Roadster’s commercial introduction, we launched a much improved Tesla Roadster 2, as well as a higher performance variant, the Tesla Roadster Sport.

 
 	•	 	
Ownership of Sales and Service Network. We believe that by owning our own sales and service network we can offer a compelling customer experience while achieving operating efficiencies and capturing sales and service revenues incumbent automobile manufacturers do not enjoy in the traditional franchised distribution and service model. We believe we will also be able to better control costs of inventory, manage warranty service and pricing, maintain and strengthen the Tesla brand, and obtain rapid customer feedback. Further, we believe we will avoid the conflict of interest in the traditional dealership structure inherent to most incumbent automobile manufacturers where the sale of warranty parts and repairs by a dealer are a key source of revenue and profit for the dealer but often are an expense for the vehicle manufacturer. Our Tesla stores do not carry large vehicle inventories and, as a result, do not require corresponding large floor spaces. As a result, we believe we can efficiently and cost-effectively build out our sales and service network.

 
 	•	 	
Brand Leadership. As the first company to commercially produce a high-performance, highway-capable fully electric vehicle, we have received substantial media attention. We believe the Tesla brand is well recognized in our target market, despite limited marketing spending by us to date. An independent third-party study completed in 2008 of over 4,000 consumers indicated that the average consumer would be more likely to buy an electric vehicle from Tesla than any other brand but Toyota/Lexus. Since that time, we believe the presence of more Tesla Roadsters on the road and increasing media attention has further strengthened the Tesla brand. In November 2009, Advertising Age provided further testament to our brand strength by selecting us as one of “America’s hottest brands” in a special report highlighting the year’s 50 top brands. We believe the strength of the Tesla brand value will

result in strong consumer interest and loyalty, strong positioning as a premium electric vehicle and reduced competitive pricing pressure.
 
 	•	 	
Substantial Funding in Place to Accelerate Growth. We have entered into our DOE Loan Facility for a $465.0 million loan and we have been granted up to approximately $31 million in tax incentives by the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority. We believe these loans and incentives will help accelerate the time to volume production for both the Model S and our electric powertrain business. In addition, we believe these loans and incentives provide us long-term financing that should enable us to focus more of our resources on the execution of our business plans.

 
 	•	 	
Capital Efficiency. We believe our rapid product development process, our modular and adaptable powertrain, our plan to design and manufacture multiple product types on a singular platform, and our ability to hold lower inventory levels while still meeting customer demand will help reduce the capital required to reach operating efficiencies. This approach is designed with the aim of allowing us to achieve profitability at relatively low volumes and create a viable long-term business.

Our Strategy
We intend to be a leading global manufacturer and direct seller of electric vehicles and electric vehicle technologies. Key elements of our strategy include:
 
 	•	 	
Successful Launch of the Model S. We believe the successful launch of the Model S is critical to our ability to capitalize on the expanding electric vehicle market opportunity. We are currently executing a detailed plan to finish the design and engineering of, and component sourcing for, the Model S and to develop the manufacturing facility and equipment to support its production. Our plan reflects a combination of what we believe are best practices from multiple industries and our experience from developing, manufacturing and marketing the Tesla Roadster. We are using advanced computer-aided design and crash simulations and concurrently engineering multiple vehicle systems which we anticipate will help speed development and enhance the safety of the Model S. Additionally, we believe our continued development of the Tesla Roadster for multiple international markets and the expansion of our retail presence in select countries around the globe will help us successfully certify, sell and distribute the Model S in these markets.

 
 	•	 	
Use a Common Platform to Introduce New Models. We intend to design the Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain that we can use to create future electric vehicle models, such as a sport utility vehicle, a cargo van or a coupe. We believe this strategy will enable us to introduce future models faster and in a more capital efficient manner than incumbent automobile manufacturers have been able to achieve in introducing traditional internal combustion vehicles.

 
 	•	 	
Develop Integrated Engineering and Manufacturing Capabilities. We intend to identify a site to locate a substantially integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility to manufacture components that are critical to our intellectual property and production of the Model S. We intend for our design, vehicle engineering, and manufacturing teams to work alongside one another in an effort to accelerate the Model S development. We also intend to design flexibility into our manufacturing facility so that we can produce multiple vehicle models on the Model S platform at high volumes on the same line. We believe that owning and operating integrated engineering and manufacturing facilities will enable us to maintain high quality control standards, and achieve cost efficiencies in our operations. In addition to developing our vehicle manufacturing facility, we are in the process of expanding our electric powertrain manufacturing facility in Palo Alto, California, which will focus on the design and manufacture of lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and components both for our vehicles and for our original equipment manufacturer customers.

 
 	•	 	
Continue to Focus on Technological Advancement and Cost Improvement. We have been able to achieve technological and design improvements in the production of the Tesla Roadster while simultaneously reducing manufacturing costs. We intend to continue to invest in technological

innovation to further advance our proprietary electric powertrain system and the safety, reliability, range capabilities and functionality of our vehicles.
 
 	•	 	
Expand our Company-Owned Sales and Service Network. As of December 31, 2009, we had opened 10 Tesla owned stores in the United States and Europe, located in Boulder, Chicago, Los Angeles, Menlo Park, Miami, New York, Seattle, London, Monaco and Munich. We plan to nearly double the number of Tesla stores opened by the end of 2010, with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within the next several years in connection with the planned Model S rollout. In addition, we intend to grow the Tesla Rangers mobile service program, which will enable our service technicians to travel to and service our customers’ vehicles in more geographic areas throughout the United States.

 
 	•	 	
Leverage Industry Advancements in Battery Cells. We intend to leverage the substantial battery cell investments and advancements being made globally by battery cell manufacturers to continue to improve the cost per kilowatt-hour of our battery pack. To this end, we have designed our powertrain technology to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry, form factor and vendor. We believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors to benefit from improvements in battery cell technologies while retaining our existing investments in battery pack management, software, electronics, testing and vehicle packaging will enable us to quickly deploy advances in battery cells into our products and leverage the most current battery cell technology.

 
 	•	 	
Build and Leverage Strategic Relationships. We intend to seek and develop strategic relationships with industry leaders to launch our electric vehicles and sell our electric vehicle powertrain components. For example, we collaborated with Daimler on the production of the battery pack for their Smart fortwo electric vehicle pilot program. We are also establishing strategic relationships with battery cell vendors who are leaders in the industry for advanced chemistries, high volume production and low cost manufacturing. We believe these and similar potential strategic relationships will enable us to efficiently expand our business while leveraging the expertise and knowledge of the automotive and related industries.

Our Vehicles and Products
We currently design, manufacture and sell the Tesla Roadster, our first production vehicle. We are designing our second vehicle, the Model S, and currently plan to begin production of the Model S in 2012. We intend to design the Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of the Model S to create future electric vehicles targeting additional segments of the passenger vehicle market.
The Tesla Roadster
Our first vehicle, the Tesla Roadster, is the first high-performance electric sports car and the only highway-capable electric vehicle available in the United States today. The two-seat, convertible Tesla Roadster has a combination of range, style, performance and energy efficiency that we believe is unmatched in the market today. As of December 31, 2009, we had sold 937 Tesla Roadsters to customers in 18 countries, almost all of which were sold to customers in North America and Europe, 107 of which were sold in the year ended December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, our customers had driven the Tesla Roadster for an estimated 3.0 million miles. The Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from, all applicable vehicle safety standards in the United States, the European Union as well as select other countries. Additionally, we have met battery shipping and testing protocols of the United Nations, United States Department of Transportation and other government agencies, allowing us to ship the Tesla Roadster to a number of countries throughout the world.
The current effective price of the base configuration of the Tesla Roadster is $101,500 in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. The Tesla Roadster offers performance characteristics that
 
97
Table of Contents

we believe are among the best in the industry. It can accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in 3.9 seconds and has a maximum speed of approximately 120 miles per hour. We believe the Tesla Roadster’s lightweight and proprietary electric powertrain provides significant performance advantages over traditional internal combustion engine-powered sports cars. Specifically, the electric powertrain that delivers peak torque (in excess of 200 foot pounds) at extremely low revolutions per minute, or rpm, and remains near peak through 7,000 rpm of the 13,000 rpm range enables the Tesla Roadster to achieve its high levels of acceleration. With such a long and flat torque curve, we believe the Tesla Roadster delivers a compelling driving experience with instantaneous and sustained acceleration through an extended range of speed.
The Tesla Roadster combines this performance with high energy efficiency. The Tesla Roadster has a battery pack capable of storing approximately 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack and has a range of 236 miles on a single charge, as determined by an independent third party using the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s, or EPA’s, combined two-cycle city/highway test. Recently, the EPA announced its intention to introduce and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours. The Tesla Roadster reportedly set a new world distance record of 313 miles for a production electric car in a rally across Australia as part of the 2009 Global Green Challenge. Assuming a 236 mile range of the Tesla Roadster and an electricity cost of 11.0 cents per kilowatt-hour, which was the average residential electricity cost in the United States as of December 31, 2009, the energy cost of powering the Tesla Roadster is approximately 3.4 cents per mile. In comparison, assuming an average gasoline price of $2.61 per gallon, which was the average price per gallon in the United States as of December 31, 2009, the 2010 Toyota Prius has a fuel cost of approximately 5.2 cents per mile and the 2009 Porsche 911 Carrera has a fuel cost of approximately 12.3 cents per mile. We believe these energy cost differences would be greater in Europe where gasoline prices can be almost three times higher than in the United States.
We have continued to rapidly develop the Tesla Roadster since its introduction. In June 2009, nine months after its commercial introduction, we launched the 2010 Tesla Roadster, known as the Tesla Roadster 2, as well as a high-performance variant, the Tesla Roadster Sport. As compared to the original Tesla Roadster, the Tesla Roadster 2 delivered a higher quality interior, a new push-button gear selector, improved heating and cooling performance, a more powerful electric powertrain, and improved noise reduction. New optional features were also added including clear coat carbon fiber trim for the exterior and interior, an adjustable suspension and improved vehicle data connectivity via a GSM module. In addition to making these enhancements, we simultaneously reduced our manufacturing costs significantly by making a number of modifications, including redesigning our power electronics module and switching to certain commodity components in our manufacturing process. The Tesla Roadster Sport offers a higher performance powertrain which improves acceleration from 0 to 60 miles per hour from 3.9 seconds to 3.7 seconds, adjustable suspension and performance tires and forged wheels, all without compromising the efficiency of the Tesla Roadster electric powertrain. The current effective price of the base configuration of the Tesla Roadster is $101,500 in the United States and the current effective price of the base configuration of the Tesla Roadster Sport is $121,000 in the United States, in each case assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a currently available United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. We delivered our first right-hand drive version of the Tesla Roadster in January 2010, enabling the eventual introduction of the Tesla Roadster into new key markets such as Japan, Hong Kong, and Australia. We also believe the right-hand drive version will allow us to further penetrate certain existing markets such as the United Kingdom.
The Tesla Model S
Our planned second vehicle, the Model S, is currently expected to begin production in 2012. We intend to leverage the electric powertrain of the Tesla Roadster to create a four-door, five adult passenger sedan that produces zero tailpipe emissions while accelerating from zero to 60 miles per hour in a targeted time of under 6 seconds. The drivable early prototype of the Model S was revealed to the public in March 2009 and as of December 31, 2009, we had received approximately 2,000 customer reservations with a minimum refundable
 
98
Table of Contents

payment of $5,000. We intend to make the Model S available with three range variants – 160 miles, 230 miles, and 300 miles, on a single charge, as projected using the EPA’s combined city/highway test cycles – to allow customers to purchase an electric vehicle that best matches their personal driving needs. We are designing the Model S to include a third row with two rear-facing child seats, subject to applicable safety regulations and requirements, allowing us to offer a seven passenger sedan. The EPA has announced its intention to develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles, which we believe could result in a significant decrease to the advertised ranges of all electric vehicles, including ours.
To complement its range capabilities, we also plan to offer the Model S with a package of recharging options, including the capability to fast charge in as little as forty-five minutes at commercial charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future. This feature would offer consumers a rapid and convenient way to recharge their vehicles. In addition, we are designing the Model S to incorporate a modular battery pack in the floor of the vehicle, enabling it to be rapidly swapped out at a specialized commercial battery exchange facility. We are designing the Model S to offer a compelling combination of functionality, convenience and styling without compromising performance and energy efficiency. With the battery pack in the floor of the vehicle and the motor and gearbox in line with the rear axle, we are designing the Model S to provide best in class storage space of approximately 26 cubic feet, including storage under both the tailgate and the hood. By way of comparison, this storage space exceeds the approximately 14 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 BMW 5 Series sedan and the approximately 21 cubic feet of storage available in the 2009 Lincoln Town Car. We are also planning to equip the Model S with premium luxury features, including a 17” touch screen driver interface, advanced wireless connectivity, and driver customization of the infotainment and climate control systems of the vehicle. We believe the intended combination of performance, styling, convenience and energy efficiency of the Model S will help position it as a compelling alternative to other vehicles in the luxury and performance segments.
We currently anticipate introducing the base Model S at an effective price of $49,900 in the United States, assuming and after giving effect to the continuation of a United States federal tax credit of $7,500 for the purchase of alternative fuel vehicles. Even without the tax credit, we believe the base list price will be competitive with other premium sedans. We have not finalized pricing for the 230 or 300 mile range variants of the Model S.
We are designing the Model S to provide a lower cost of ownership as compared to other vehicles in its class. We consider the purchase price, cost of fuel, and the cost of maintenance over a six year ownership period in this calculation. We assume comparable residual values, warranties, insurance costs and promotions and assume that currently available consumer incentives are still available at the time of a Model S purchase. In addition to the competitive pricing of the Model S relative to other premium sedans, we estimate that customers of electric vehicles will enjoy lower fuel costs. For example, assuming an average of 12,000 miles driven per year, an average electricity cost of 11.0 cents per kilowatt-hour and an average gasoline price of $2.61 per gallon over the full ownership of the vehicle, which were the average electricity cost and gasoline price in the United States, respectively, as of December 31, 2009, and based on our estimate of the energy efficiency of the Model S, we estimate that our planned Model S could have approximately $1,300 per year less in fuel costs than a comparable premium internal combustion engine sedan. Furthermore, we expect the planned Model S will have a lower maintenance costs than comparable premium internal combustion engine sedans due to fewer moving parts and the absence of certain components, including oil, oil filters, spark plugs, and engine valves.
Future Vehicle Roadmap Based on Model S Platform
We intend to design the Model S with an adaptable platform architecture and common electric powertrain so that we can use the platform of the Model S to create future electric vehicle models, such as a sport utility vehicle, a cargo van or a coupe. In particular, by designing our electric powertrain within the chassis to accommodate different vehicle body styles, we believe that we can save significant time in future vehicle development. In addition, we believe our strategy of using commercially available battery cells will enable us to leverage improvements in cell chemistries and rapidly introduce models of our Tesla Roadster and planned

vehicles with different range options. Our design of the Model S, however, is not complete and we may make changes to the design of the Model S, including changes that may make it more difficult to use the Model S platform for future vehicles.
Powertrain Development and Sales
In May 2009, we entered into a development agreement with Daimler under which we performed specified research and development services for the development of a battery pack and charger for Daimler’s Smart fortwo electric drive. All development work related to the development agreement had been completed as of December 31, 2009. We have been selected by Daimler to supply it with up to 1,000 battery packs and chargers to support a trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive in five European cities. We began shipping the first of these battery packs and chargers in November 2009 and started to recognize revenue for these sales in the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
We intend to develop our electric powertrain component and systems business and have secured a $101.2 million loan under our DOE Loan Facility for the expansion of our engineering and production capability for this business in our Palo Alto facility. We anticipate our new facility will enable us to provide research and development services, including cell and component testing and prototyping, as well as produce powertrain components for sales to third parties. We also intend to centralize production of the battery pack and the motor for the Tesla Roadster at this facility so that we can efficiently share further powertrain innovations among the components for our vehicles as well as those of our customers.
Technology
We believe the core competency of our company and our core intellectual property is contained within our electric powertrain. This powertrain is fundamentally composed of four major elements: a modular battery pack, a power electronics module, a motor and the control software which enables the components to operate as a system. We designed each of these major elements for our Tesla Roadster and plan to use much of this technology in the Model S and our future electric vehicles. Our powertrain and battery pack have a modular design, enabling future generations of electric vehicles to incorporate a significant amount of this technology. Further, our powertrain is very compact and contains far fewer moving parts than the internal combustion powertrain. These features enable us to adapt it for a variety of applications, including our future vehicles and any powertrain components we build for other manufacturers.
From time to time, we intend to enter into development arrangements with other automobile manufacturers for electric powertrain development activities. From inception through September 30, 2009, our powertrain development activities have been exclusively pursuant to a development arrangement entered into in the year ended December 31, 2008 which was formalized pursuant to an agreement entered into in May 2009 with Daimler related to the development of a battery pack and charger for Daimler’s Smart fortwo electric drive. All amounts received under this development agreement are being recognized as an offset to research and development expenses in the consolidated statement of operations. In the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, our research and development expenses were $25.0 million, $62.8 million, $53.7 million and $11.1 million, respectively after such offsets. As of December 31, 2009 all development work related to the development agreement had been completed and we expect that the full $23.2 million under the development agreement will be recognized in the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
As of December 31, 2009, we had 120 employees in our research and development department.
Battery Pack
We have designed our battery pack to have a life of over 100,000 miles. In addition, we have designed the battery pack to be modular so that it can be used in more than one vehicle. For example, the Tesla Roadster
 
100
Table of Contents

battery pack contains 6,831 lithium-ion cells, each similar to the 6 to 12 cells (made by third party lithium-ion cell providers) found in many standard laptop computers. The cells, in turn, are housed in 11 modules. The battery pack contains 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy, almost double the energy of any other commercially available electric vehicle battery pack, thereby significantly increasing vehicle range capability. Designing an electric powertrain and a vehicle to exploit its energy efficiency has required extensive safety testing and innovation in battery packs, motors, powertrain systems and vehicle engineering. Our proprietary technology includes cooling systems, safety systems, battery engineering for vibration and environmental durability, robotic manufacturing processes, customized motor design, and the software and electronics management systems necessary to manage battery and vehicle performance under demanding real-life driving conditions. We have significant experience and expertise in the safety and management systems needed to work with lithium-ion cells in the demanding automotive environment. We believe these advancements have enabled us to produce a battery pack at a low cost per kilowatt-hour. As of December 31, 2009, our customers had driven the Tesla Roadster for an estimated 3.0 million miles.
We believe one of our core competencies is the design of our complete battery pack system. We have designed our battery pack system to permit flexibility with respect to battery cell chemistry, form factor and vendor that we adopt for battery cell supply. We maintain an internal battery cell testing lab and an extensive performance database of the many available lithium-ion cell vendors and chemistry types. We intend to incorporate the battery cells that provide the best value and performance possible into our battery packs, and we expect this to continue over time as battery cells continue to improve in energy storage capacity, longevity, power delivery and cost. We believe this flexibility will enable us to continue to evaluate new battery cells as they become commercially viable, and thereby optimize battery pack system performance and cost for our current and future vehicles. We believe our ability to change battery cell chemistries and vendors while retaining our existing investments in software, electronics, testing and vehicle packaging, will enable us to quickly deploy various battery cells into our products and leverage the latest advancements in battery cell technology.
The range of our electric vehicles on a single charge declines principally as a function of usage, time and charging patterns. For example, a customer’s use of their Tesla vehicle as well as the frequency with which they charge the battery of their Tesla vehicle can result in additional deterioration of the battery’s ability to hold a charge. We currently expect that our battery pack will retain approximately 60-65% of its ability to hold its initial charge after approximately 100,000 miles or 7 years, which will result in a decrease to the vehicle’s initial range.
To date, we have tested hundreds of battery cells of different chemistries, form factors and designs. Based on this evaluation, we are presently using lithium-ion battery cells based on the 18650 form factor in the Tesla Roadster. These battery cells are commercially available in large quantities. We currently intend to use the same battery cell form factor in the Model S.
Power Electronics Module
The power electronics module, or PEM, has two primary functions, the control of torque generation in the motor while driving and the control of energy delivery back into the battery pack while charging. Since our powertrains today use alternating current 3-phase induction motors, we need to create alternating current and voltage from the direct current that the battery provides. The PEM performs this function both when charging and discharging the battery.
Inside of the PEM are two distinct areas, the power section or “engine room” and the command and control section. We believe we have made significant innovations in each area. We have designed the command and control section to use a high-performance digital signal processor which runs some of the most complicated and detailed software in the vehicle.
We believe another significant innovation in our PEM is our ability to combine the battery charger into the same unit as the motor controller. This is not simply putting two separate systems into the same box as is the case
 
101
Table of Contents

with some other powertrains. Instead, we have reconfigured the same hardware and have used software to accomplish this reconfiguration. By combining these functions we are able to carry a high-power charger onboard the vehicle with no significant extra cost or weight. This enables us to use any available source of power to charge our vehicle. Our vehicles can recharge on any electrical outlet from a common outlet of 15 amps and 120 volts all the way up to a high power outlet of 70 amps and 240 volts, which provides optimal recharging.
Since the Tesla Roadster charger system is built into the vehicle, it is possible to charge the vehicle using a variety of power outlets. Charging the Tesla Roadster battery pack to full capacity will take approximately 9 hours using a 240 volt, 30 amp outlet that is widely available in many homes in the United States for electric appliances. A high power connection capable of 240 volts and 70 amps reduces this charging time to about 4.5 hours. Such a connection can be installed in many homes with the assistance of a qualified electrician. For additional flexibility, the Tesla Roadster battery pack can also be charged with a 120 volt, 15 amp connection. Using this lower power output, the Tesla Roadster battery pack can be charged to full capacity in about 42 hours. This flexibility in charging provides customers with additional mobility, while also allowing them to conveniently charge the vehicle overnight at home.
For the Model S, we plan to offer a fast charge option that will enable the vehicle to charge from higher amperage, higher voltage commercial charging stations that we anticipate may be available in the future.
Motor
Our powertrains currently use custom designed 3-phase induction motors. We believe we have made several important innovations in our motor design that minimize mass while still providing high power and efficiency. Our motors incorporate a proprietary fabricated copper rotor design. Our motors also include optimized winding patterns that allow for easy manufacture and fit in as much copper as possible to reduce resistance and energy losses.
We also use high-quality bearings and precision balancing on the rotor and shaft to enable the spin of the motor up to 13,000 revolutions per minute, or rpm, in normal operation. Combining this very high rpm rating with an instantaneous stall torque of over 200 foot pounds gives a broad torque-speed map that allows a single speed gearbox to deliver high vehicle performance.
Control Software
The performance and safety systems of the Tesla Roadster and its battery required the development of sophisticated control software. There are numerous processors in the Tesla Roadster to control these functions, and we write custom firmware for many of these processors. The flow of electricity between the battery pack and the motor must be tightly controlled in order to deliver the performance and behavior expected in the vehicle. For example, software algorithms enable the vehicle to mimic the “creep” feeling which drivers expect from an internal combustion engine vehicle without having to apply pressure on the accelerator. Similar algorithms control traction, vehicle stability and the sustained acceleration and regenerative braking of the vehicle. Drivers use the information systems in the Tesla Roadster to optimize performance and charging modes and times. Software also is used extensively to monitor the charge state of each of the cells of the battery pack and to manage all of its safety systems.
We plan to leverage our investment in software for the development of the Model S. In addition to the vehicle control software, we also intend to develop software for the infotainment system of the Model S.
Vehicle Design and Engineering
In addition to the design and development of the powertrain, we have created significant in-house capabilities in the design and engineering of electric vehicles and electric vehicle components and systems. We

design and engineer bodies, chassis, interiors, heating and cooling and low voltage electrical systems in house and to a lesser extent in conjunction with our suppliers. We are building core competencies in computer aided design and crash test simulations which we expect to reduce the product development time of new models.
Several traditional automotive subsystems required substantial redesign and custom optimization to integrate with the powertrain of an electric vehicle. For example, the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, or HVAC, system was redesigned to integrate with the battery thermal management system and to operate without the energy generated from an internal combustion engine. In addition, low voltage electric systems which power features such as the radio, power windows, and heated seats also needed to be designed specifically for use in an electric vehicle. We have developed expertise in integrating these components with the high-voltage power source in the vehicle and in designing components that significantly reduce their load on the vehicle battery pack, thereby maximizing the available range of the vehicle.
Additionally, our team has expertise in lightweight materials, a very important characteristic for electric vehicles given the impact of mass on range. The Tesla Roadster is built with an internally-designed carbon fiber body which provides a balance of strength and mass. We intend to build the Model S with a lightweight aluminum body and have been designing the body and chassis with a variety of materials and production methods that will help optimize the weight of the vehicle.
We intend to develop a substantially-integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility to manufacture components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality of the Model S. We intend for our vehicle design, engineering, and manufacturing teams to work alongside one another in an effort to accelerate the Model S development. We believe the co-location of our vehicle design, engineering and manufacturing teams will help accelerate the development of new products and allow for faster introduction of product changes.
As of December 31, 2009, we had 71 employees in our vehicle design and engineering department.
Sales and Marketing
Target Market
We believe the size of the relevant markets for Tesla vehicles is a function of both the market for electric-based vehicles and the market for the traditional segments targeted by our vehicles. Specifically, we believe our Tesla Roadster and planned Model S may appeal to some consumers because the vehicle offers functionality and performance relative to the traditional class of vehicle desired by the consumer, such as the premium sports vehicle market for the Tesla Roadster or the premium sedan market for the Model S. However, we also believe our Tesla Roadster and planned Model S may appeal to consumers who are environmentally and politically conscious or who are interested in the technological and economic benefits of electric vehicles.
The Tesla Roadster
We believe the Tesla Roadster competes in the premium sport vehicle market against selected premium roadsters and coupes. According to CSM Worldwide, the Porsche 911, the Chevrolet Corvette, the Jaguar XK and the Mercedes SL and SLK together represent approximately 97,000 vehicle sales in North America and Europe in 2008. The base list prices for 2009 models in the premium roadsters and coupes market ranged from approximately $47,000 for the Mercedes SLK to $140,700 for the 911 Turbo Cabriolet in the United States.
The Tesla Model S
We believe the combination of functionality, performance, style, energy efficiency and overall cost of ownership of the planned Model S will draw buyers from several market segments, including the lower, medium and upper premium sedan classes. According to CSM Worldwide, the Audi A3, A4, A6 and A8, the BMW 3, 5

and 7 series, the Lexus IS, ES, GS and LS, the Volvo S40, S60, S80, V50, and V70/XC70 and the Mercedes C, CLS, E and S Class together represent approximately 2.1 million vehicle sales in the United States and Europe in 2008. The base list prices for 2009 models in the premium sedan and equivalents market ranged from approximately $29,000 for the Volvo S40 to $96,000 for the Audi S8 (the high-performance version of the Audi A8) in the United States.
Company-Owned Sales
We market and sell cars directly to consumers. Until we opened our first store in Los Angeles, California in May 2008, all of our sales of the Tesla Roadster were conducted via the phone and internet, or in-person at our headquarters and corporate events. Increasingly, sales are being made through our network of Tesla stores. Our Tesla stores are highly visible, premium outlets in major metropolitan markets that combine retail sales and service. As of December 31, 2009, we had opened 10 Tesla owned stores in the United States and Europe, located in Boulder, Chicago, Los Angeles, Menlo Park, Miami, New York, Seattle, London, Monaco and Munich. We plan to nearly double the number of Tesla stores opened by the end of 2010, with a goal of establishing approximately 50 stores globally within the next several years in connection with the planned Model S rollout.
In 2009, the average cost of building out our stores was approximately $500,000 per store. Going forward, we generally expect the build out cost of opening new stores to range from approximately $500,000 to $1 million per store. Since we plan to maintain only limited inventory at our stores, we do not require large floor spaces. We believe our Tesla store operating costs are low relative to traditional dealers as a result of our small store footprint, low head count and limited inventories. As a result, we believe we can efficiently and cost-effectively build out our sales and service network.
Our Tesla stores offer several benefits to our customers. The integrated design of our Tesla stores and service centers showcases our vehicles and permits customers and potential customers to have an unobstructed view of Tesla vehicles being serviced. Our customers deal directly with our own Tesla-employed sales and service staff, creating what we believe is a differentiated buying experience from the buying experience consumers have with franchised automobile dealers and service centers.
Reservations
We typically carry very limited inventory of our vehicles at our Tesla stores. While some customers purchase their vehicles from this inventory, most of our Tesla Roadster customers choose to select the options and customize the appearance of their vehicle. Potential customers may reserve slots in our production schedule for their vehicle by entering into a reservation agreement and paying a refundable reservation payment. Reservation payments are used by us to fund, in part, our working capital requirements and help us to align production with demand. If the prospective customer decides to purchase a vehicle, the reservation payment can be used toward the purchase of a vehicle. In the United States, we accept reservations for our Tesla Roadster with a $9,900 reservation payment and for the Model S with a minimum $5,000 reservation payment. In the United States, approximately three months prior to production of a Tesla Roadster, we require the customer to make full payment of the balance owed on the vehicle to lock in a production slot. Our current reservation agreements for the Tesla Roadster provides that prior to locking in the production slot for the Tesla Roadster, reservation payments are refundable, less a cancellation fee of $250. After locking in the production slot, the reservation payments are not refundable. For the Model S, our current reservation agreements provide for a $50 cancellation fee until the customer selects options. Upon selection of options, the customer will make an additional reservation payment, following which the cancellation fee becomes $10,000. The drivable early prototype of the Model S was revealed to the public in March 2009 and as of December 31, 2009, we had received approximately 2,000 customer reservations for the vehicle. As of September 30, 2009, we had an aggregate of $24.8 million in refundable reservation payments for the Tesla Roadster and the Model S.

Marketing
Our principal marketing goals are to:
 
 	•	 	
generate demand for our vehicles and drive leads to our sales teams;

 
 	•	 	
build long-term brand awareness and manage corporate reputation;

 
 	•	 	
manage our existing customer base to create loyalty and customer referrals; and

 
 	•	 	
enable customer input into the product development process.

As the first and currently only company to commercially produce a federally-compliant, fully electric vehicle that achieves market-leading range on one charge, we have been able to generate significant media coverage of our company and our vehicles, and we believe we will continue to do so. To date, media coverage and word-of-mouth have been the primary drivers of our sales leads and have helped us achieve sales without traditional advertising and at relatively low marketing costs. We also use traditional means of advertising including product placement in a variety of media outlets and pay-per-click advertisements on websites and applications relevant to our target demographics.
The strength of our brand has been highlighted by independent authorities. An independent third-party study completed in 2008 of over 4,000 consumers indicated that the average consumer would be more likely to buy an electric vehicle from Tesla than any other brand but Toyota/Lexus. Since that time, we believe the presence of more Tesla Roadsters on the road and increasing media attention has further strengthened the Tesla brand. In November 2009, Advertising Age provided further testament to our brand strength by selecting us as one of “America’s hottest brands” in a special report highlighting the year’s 50 top brands.
Our marketing efforts include events where our vehicles are displayed and demonstrated. These events range from widely attended public events, such as the Detroit, Los Angeles, and Frankfurt auto shows, to smaller events oriented towards sales, such as private drive events.
As of December 31, 2009, we had 83 employees in our sales and marketing department.
Company-Owned Service and Warranty
Service
Service of our electric vehicles takes place at most of our Tesla stores. In addition, in the United States, we are able to provide service coverage to our customers who do not live in close proximity to our stores through our mobile service technicians known as the Tesla Rangers. We charge customers $1 per mile for our Tesla Rangers technicians’ return trip from the location of the customer’s vehicle to the nearest Tesla store.
Tesla owners can upload data from their vehicle and send it to us on a memory stick or via an on-board GSM system, allowing us to diagnose and remedy many problems before ever looking at the vehicle. When maintenance or service is required, a customer can schedule service by contacting one of our regional Tesla stores. Our Tesla Rangers can perform an array of procedures at a remote location, from annual inspections and firmware upgrades to full replacement of a power electronics module and other mechanical and electrical components. If service is more extensive and requires a vehicle lift, we can coordinate shipping of vehicles to and from the nearest Tesla store.
We believe that our company-owned service enables our technicians to work closely with our engineers and research and development teams in Silicon Valley to identify problems, find solutions, and incorporate improvements faster than incumbent automobile manufacturers.
As of December 31, 2009, we had 35 employees in our service department.

New Vehicle Limited Warranty Policy
We provide a three year or 36,000 mile New Vehicle Limited Warranty with every Tesla Roadster, which we extended to four years or 50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. Customers have the opportunity to purchase an Extended Service Plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 36,000 miles, whichever comes first. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty is similar to other vehicle manufacturer’s warranty programs and is intended to cover all parts and labor to repair defects in material or workmanship in the body, chassis, suspension, interior, electronic systems, battery, powertrain and brake system. Exceptions to the New Vehicle Limited Warranty include wear items such as tires, brake pads and rotors, paint wear and tear, interior wear and tear, and battery performance.
Battery Replacement Option
While battery failure due to defects in material or workmanship is included in the New Vehicle Limited Warranty, battery performance, specifically its ability to store electricity over time, is not covered in either the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or the Extended Service Plan. However, within three months of purchasing their vehicle, customers may purchase a one time option to replace the battery pack at any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle. For customers that select this option, we agree to replace the original battery of the vehicle with a replacement battery which will store at least 53 kilowatt-hours of usable energy. Charges in addition to the option purchase price apply if the customer exercises the battery replacement option prior to the seventh anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle. The customer is entitled to a partial refund of the option purchase price if the option is not elected by the eighth anniversary of the purchase date of the vehicle.
Manufacturing
Vehicle Assembly
We currently use a multi-site manufacturing process for production of the Tesla Roadster and plan to transition to a substantially integrated site for production of the Model S and future vehicles. The initial body and chassis assembly processes for our Tesla Roadster occur at a Lotus Cars Limited, or Lotus, facility in Hethel, England where our staff works closely with Lotus. For vehicles destined for the United States or Asian markets, we ship the rolling chassis, which does not contain our electric powertrain and which we call a glider, to our final assembly facility in Menlo Park, California. At our Menlo Park location, we install the full electric vehicle powertrain and perform a pre-delivery inspection prior to shipping the Tesla Roadster to customers. For European deliveries, the full vehicle is assembled on-line at the Lotus facility and pre-delivery inspection occurs at a nearby Tesla facility in Wymondham, England. Pursuant to the supply agreement with Lotus, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 1,700 vehicles or gliders over the three year term of the agreement, which will expire in March 2011. We do not currently have a supply agreement with Lotus for the supply of Tesla Roadster vehicles or gliders beyond the 1,700 minimum referenced above. As of December 31, 2009, we had purchased approximately 1,000 vehicles or gliders under this agreement.
We intend to develop a substantially-integrated electric vehicle manufacturing facility to manufacture components that are critical to our intellectual property and quality of the Model S, including body assembly, paint operations, battery pack manufacturing, final vehicle assembly and end-of-line testing. Certain major component systems, such as interior console and seats, will be purchased from suppliers. We currently intend to target an annual production rate at this facility for the Model S of up to approximately 20,000 cars per year. We believe that we will be able to increase the annual production capacity of this plant beyond this amount through additional capital spending as well as by changing operating patterns and adding additional shifts.

Powertrain Component Manufacturing
We manufacture several components of our electric powertrain and the batteries and chargers that we have started to sell to Daimler.
 
 	•	 	
Motor. Our copper-rotor alternating current induction motors have historically been manufactured at our Taiwanese subsidiary. We have operated our own manufacturing facility in part to protect the proprietary technology we developed for our motor. We are presently transitioning this operation to our new corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, California. We expect to complete this transition in the first half of 2010.

 
 	•	 	
Battery Packs. We currently assemble the Tesla Roadster and Daimler Smart fortwo electric drive batteries at our facilities in San Carlos, California. These operations are also transitioning to our Palo Alto facility where we plan to produce batteries and chargers for additional technology sales customers. We expect to complete this transition in the first half of 2010.

 
 	•	 	
Power Electronics Module. Our power electronics module, or PEM, is manufactured based on our design by a contract manufacturer located in Taiwan.

We intend to develop our electric powertrain component and systems business and have secured a $101.2 million loan under our DOE Loan Facility for the expansion of our engineering and production capability for this business in our Palo Alto facility.
Supply Chain
The Tesla Roadster uses over 2,000 purchased parts which we source from over 150 suppliers, many of whom are currently our single source suppliers for these components. Our supply base is located globally, with about 30% of our suppliers located in North America, 40% in Europe and the remaining 30% in Asia. We have developed close relationships with several key suppliers particularly in the procurement of cells and certain electric powertrain components. While we obtain components from multiple sources whenever possible, similar to other automobile manufacturers, many of the components used in our vehicles must be custom made for us. We refer to these component suppliers as our single source suppliers. In addition, Lotus is the only manufacturer for certain components, such as the rolling chassis of our Tesla Roadster, and we refer to it as a sole source supplier. To date, we have not qualified alternative sources for most of the single sourced components used in our vehicles and we generally do not maintain long-term agreements with our single source or sole source suppliers. For example, while several sources of the battery cell we have selected for the Tesla Roadster are available, we have fully qualified only one supplier for these cells. Any disruption in the supply of battery cells from such vendor could temporarily disrupt production of the Tesla Roadster until such time as a different supplier is fully qualified and there can be no assurance that we would be able to successfully retain alternative suppliers on a timely basis. Moreover, battery cell manufactures may choose to refuse to supply electric vehicle manufacturers to the extent they determine that the vehicles are not sufficiently safe.
While we believe that we may be able to establish alternate supply relationships and can obtain or engineer replacement components, we may be unable to do so in the short term or at all at prices or costs that are favorable to us. We are currently evaluating, qualifying and selecting our suppliers for the planned production of the Model S and we intend to establish dual suppliers for several key components of the Model S, although we expect that a number of components for the Model S will be single sourced. In addition, we have entered into a letter of intent with Mercedes-Benz USA, LLC, an affiliate of Daimler, whereby it will provide us access to its parts catalogue. We contemplate using such parts in the Model S during its development phase and ultimately in its production. We intend to negotiate an agreement to finalize this arrangement.
We use various raw materials in our business including aluminum, steel, carbon fiber, non-ferrous metals such as copper, as well as cobalt. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions and global demand for these materials. We believe that we have adequate supplies or sources of availability of the raw materials necessary to meet our manufacturing and supply requirements. There are always risks and uncertainties, however, with respect to the supply of raw materials that could impact their availability in sufficient quantities or reasonable prices to meet our needs.

Table of Contents

We have implemented enterprise resource planning and management software to automate our procurement and inventory processes and integrate them with our financial accounting. We plan additional investment in our management systems to support further growth in our operations.
Quality Control
Our quality control efforts are divided between product quality and supplier quality, both of which are focused on designing and producing products and processes with high levels of reliability. Our product quality engineers work with our engineering team and our suppliers to help ensure that the product designs meet functional specifications and durability requirements. Our supplier quality engineers work with our suppliers to insure that their processes and systems are capable of delivering the parts we need at the required quality level, on time, and on budget. Our quality systems engineers create and manage our systems, such as configuration management and corrective action systems, to help ensure product developers, supplier chain managers, and production controllers have the product information they need.
As of December 31, 2009, we had 142 employees in our manufacturing department.
Customers and Selected Relationships
We currently sell our cars primarily to individual customers. We have strategic or commercial relationships with Daimler and Lotus, as well as with various battery cell providers. We intend to expand our business by developing and selling additional powertrain components to Daimler and other third party OEMs, and have secured a $101.2 million loan under our DOE Loan Facility to fund the infrastructure for this business.
Daimler AG
Beginning in 2008, we commenced efforts on a powertrain development arrangement with Daimler. In May 2009, we entered into a development agreement with Daimler under which we have performed specified research and development services for the development of a battery pack and charger for Daimler’s Smart fortwo electric drive. All development work related to the development agreement had been completed as of December 31, 2009. We have been selected by Daimler to supply it with up to 1,000 battery packs and chargers from us to support a trial of the Smart fortwo electric drive in several cities in Europe and the United States. We began shipping the first sets of these battery packs and chargers in November 2009 and started to recognize revenue for these sales in the quarter ended December 31, 2009.
In addition to the development agreement described above, we have entered into an exclusivity and intellectual property agreement, or EIP Agreement, with Daimler North America Corporation, or DNAC, an affiliate of Daimler, in which we agreed to begin negotiating in good faith to enter into further agreements within certain strategic cooperation areas, including technology collaboration in various electric powertrain areas, automotive engineering support, joint electric vehicle development efforts and access to component parts for Tesla designed products. Under this EIP Agreement, we agreed that, until November 11, 2009, we would not negotiate or enter into any agreements with other parties that would be competitive with the arrangements contemplated for these strategic cooperation areas, unless the results of such arrangement would be marketed solely under the Tesla brand. As of that date, we had not executed any further agreements with Daimler in the areas of strategic cooperation.
The EIP Agreement provides that ending on the earlier of May 11, 2014 or three years following consummation of our initial public offering, if the company receives an offer from a strategic competitor of Daimler to enter into an agreement for development of a non-Tesla branded vehicle or an integrated electric powertrain system, DNAC would be given the right of first refusal to enter into such agreement with the company instead of, and on the same terms offered by, the third party.
 
108
Table of Contents

The EIP Agreement also provides that if we execute a strategic cooperation agreement with DNAC to jointly engineer an electric vehicle, then additional exclusivities would apply until the earlier of May 11, 2014 or three years following consummation of our initial public offering, provided a minimum annual volume of sales is achieved. The EIP Agreement provides that none of the restrictions set out in that agreement, or in any strategic agreement, would limit us from developing technology with any third party for use in a Tesla-branded product or service or related to the Tesla Roadster or Model S, engaging in any transaction with a company that is not a Daimler competitor, or supplying components for electric powertrains that are designed by third parties.
The EIP Agreement also provides that if the parties enter into the strategic agreements or further agreements, those agreements will allocate intellectual property rights according to certain principles outlined in the EIP Agreement. In addition, until the earlier of May 11, 2014 or three years following consummation of our initial public offering, before licensing intellectual property generated outside the scope of any strategic cooperation area to a Daimler competitor, we would first have to offer DNAC the right to license the intellectual property on a non-exclusive, royalty-bearing basis, or on an exclusive basis in the automotive field; and if DNAC requests the latter, we must negotiate such a license in good faith. If no agreement is reached, however, we would be free to license the technology to the Daimler competitor, and DNAC could take a non-exclusive license.
Both we and Daimler have the right to terminate the EIP Agreement in the event the other party undergoes, or executes an agreement to undergo, a change of control. Any strategic cooperation agreements entered into between us and Daimler prior to termination will not be affected by such termination.
To date, with the exception of the development agreement for the Smart for two electric drive, the strategic agreements described in the EIP Agreement have not been entered into, and there can be no assurance that the parties will ever enter into such agreements. Even if we were to enter into such agreements, the parties may negotiate and agree to terms that are different to those set forth in the EIP Agreement and outlined above. Such different or new terms may be more or less favorable to us.
In addition to these agreements, Blackstar lnvestco LLC, or Blackstar, an affiliate of Daimler, held approximately         % of our capital stock outstanding as of December 31, 2009, based on             shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2009, after giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into common stock effective immediately prior to the closing of this offering and the issuance of             shares of common stock upon the assumed net exercise of warrants that expire upon the completion of this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $             per share, and Blackstar’s representative, Dr. Herbert Kohler, serves as a member of our Board of Directors.
Lotus Cars Limited
Lotus currently provides us with assembly and other manufacturing services. Although we complete the final assembly of our Tesla Roadster, the initial body and chassis assembly processes occur at a Lotus facility in Hethel, England where our staff works closely with Lotus. For vehicles destined for the United States or Asian market, we ship the glider to our final assembly facility in Menlo Park, California. For European deliveries, the full vehicle is assembled on-line at the Lotus facility and pre-delivery inspection occurs at a Tesla facility in Wymondham, England. Pursuant to the supply agreement with Lotus, we are obligated to purchase a minimum of 1,700 vehicles or gliders over the three year term of the agreement, which will expire in March 2011. We do not currently have a supply agreement with Lotus for the supply of Tesla Roadster vehicles or gliders beyond the 1,700 minimum referenced above. If we are unable to meet this volume requirement, we are still responsible for payment to Lotus of the lesser of the sum of the actual costs incurred and an agreed upon profit margin per vehicle up to the minimum volume requirement or £5,400,000. As of December 31, 2009, we had purchased approximately 1,000 vehicles or gliders under this agreement.

Governmental Programs, Incentives and Regulations
United States Department of Energy Loans
On January 20, 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing Bank, or FFB, and the United States Department of Energy, or DOE, under the DOE’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program, as set forth in Section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, or ATVM Program. We refer to such loan facility as the DOE Loan Facility. Under the DOE Loan Facility, FFB has made available to us two multi-draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $465.0 million and the DOE has agreed to reimburse FFB for any liabilities, losses, costs or expenses incurred by FFB with respect to the term loan facilities. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $101.2 million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the powertrain engineering and the build-out of a facility to design and manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and electric components, or the Powertrain Facility. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $363.9 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the development of, and to build out the manufacturing facility for, our Model S sedan, or the Model S Facility. Under the DOE Loan Facility, we are responsible for the remaining 20% of the costs eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the projects as well as any cost overruns for each project. The costs paid by us to date for the Powertrain Facility and the Model S Facility will be applied towards our obligation to contribute 20% of the eligible project costs, and the DOE’s funding of future eligible costs will be adjusted to take this into account. Our remaining obligations for these projects are budgeted to be an aggregate of $33 million, plus any cost overruns for the projects.
Our ability to draw down funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions. For the Powertrain Facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain manufacturing facility and the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. For the Model S Facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the Model S and the planned Model S manufacturing facility, including an environmental assessment of such facility approved by the DOE and completion of the National Environmental Policy Act process. Certain advances will be subject to additional conditions to drawdown related to the site on which the applicable project is located.
We will be required to maintain, at all times, available cash and cash equivalents of at least 105% of the amounts required to fund such commitment, after taking into account current cash flows and cash on hand, including cash on hand amounts raised in this offering, and reasonable projections of future generation of net cash from operations, losses and expenditures.
Loans may be requested under the facilities until January 22, 2013, and we have committed to complete the projects being financed prior to such date. On the closing date, we paid a facility fee to the DOE in the amount of $0.5 million. We intend to receive the first drawdown under each facility starting in the first quarter of 2010. We plan to make an initial request for eligible project costs under both projects that we have incurred from December 15, 2008 through September 30, 2009.
Advances under the DOE Loan Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the date of the advance, and will be based on the Treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal installments for such advance. Interest on advances under the DOE Loan Facility is payable quarterly in arrears. Advances under the Powertrain Facility are repayable in 28 equal quarterly installments commencing on December 15, 2012 (or, for advances made after such date, in 26 equal quarterly installments commencing on June 15, 2013). All outstanding amounts under the Powertrain Facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of September 15, 2019. Advances under the Model S Facility are repayable in 40 equal quarterly installments commencing on December 15, 2012 (or, for advances made after such date, in 38 equal quarterly installments commencing on June 15, 2013). All outstanding amounts under the Model S Facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of September 15, 2022. Advances under the loan facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at any time at a

price determined based on interest rates at the time of prepayment for loans made from the Secretary of the Treasury to FFB for obligations with an identical payment schedule to the advance being prepaid, which could result in the advance being prepaid at a discount, at par or at a premium. The loan facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment with net cash proceeds received from certain dispositions, loss events with respect to property and other extraordinary receipts.
All obligations under the DOE Loan Facility are secured by substantially all of our property. All of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries will also be required to guaranty our obligations under the DOE Loan Facility. Our existing and future foreign subsidiaries may, under certain circumstances, be required to guaranty our obligations under the loan facility. Any such guarantees by existing and future subsidiaries will be secured by substantially all of the property of such subsidiaries.
The DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among others, a requirement that the projects be conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project; compliance with all requirements of the ATVM Program; and limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business, and enter into certain restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions.
The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities, and (i) through December 15, 2012, a minimum cash balance, and (ii) after December 15, 2012, a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a limit on capital expenditures and, after March 31, 2014, a maximum ratio of total liabilities to shareholder equity. Under the DOE Loan Facility, we are required to fund a debt service reserve account on or before December 31, 2012, in an amount equal to all principal and interest that will come due on the advances on the next two payment dates. Once we have deposited such two payments, we will not be required to further fund such debt service reserve account. We have also agreed that, in connection with the sale of our common stock in this offering, at least 75% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us and, in connection with the sale of our stock in any other follow-on equity offering, at least 50% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us. Offering proceeds may not be used to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers, directors, employees or consultants in excess of the amounts contemplated by our business plan approved by the DOE.
In addition to our obligation to fund a portion of the project costs as described above, we have agreed to set aside 50% of the net proceeds from this offering and any subsequent offerings of stock occurring before the completion of the projects up to an aggregate of $100 million, to fund a separate, dedicated account under our DOE Loan Facility. We will use amounts deposited into this dedicated account to fund project costs of the Powertrain Facility and the Model S Facility which would have otherwise been funded through advances made under the DOE Loan Facility such that, while there are funds available in the dedicated account, for each dollar of project costs advanced under the DOE Loan Facility, one dollar of project costs that would otherwise have been funded under the DOE Loan Facility will be funded from the dedicated account. The dedicated account can also be used by us to fund any cost overruns for these projects. Once the funds deposited into this dedicated account have been used in full, we will be reimbursed by the drawdown of additional funds for amounts paid from this account, and we will be required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account in an amount equal to up to 30% of the remaining project costs for the applicable project. These amounts will similarly be used to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the drawdown of additional funds once used in full.
The DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary events of default, subject in some cases to customary cure periods for certain defaults. Events of default include, among others, non-payment defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties, covenant defaults, defaults under or termination of our leases for the projects, a default in the event of a change of control, including a failure of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer,

Product Architect and Chairman, and certain of his affiliates, at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating to the Model S Facility, to own at least 65% of capital stock held by Mr. Musk and such affiliates as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility, cross-defaults to certain other material indebtedness, failure to timely complete the projects, material judgment defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults and force majeure events with respect to the projects. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of all obligations under the DOE Loan Facility documents, an obligation by us and any guarantor to repay all obligations in full, and the exercise of remedies by the DOE or their agent. Our failure to make a timely payment could result in an increase to the applicable interest rate.
In connection with the DOE Loan Facility, we have also issued the DOE a warrant to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our Series E Preferred Stock. Beginning on December 15, 2018 and until December 14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the prior quarter. The warrant may be exercised until December 15, 2023. If we prepay the DOE Loan Facility in full prior to December 15, 2018, no shares will be exercisable under the warrant, except in the case of an event of default, which could accelerate the vesting.
California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority Tax Incentives
In December 2009, we finalized an arrangement with the California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority that will result in an exemption from California state sales and use taxes for up to $320 million of manufacturing equipment. To the extent all of this equipment is purchased and would otherwise be subject to California state sales and use tax, we believe this incentive would result in tax savings by us of up to approximately $31 million over a three year period starting in December 2009. The equipment purchases may be used only for three purposes: (i) to establish our production facility for the Model S sedan in California, (ii) to upgrade our Palo Alto powertrain production facility, and (iii) to expand our current Tesla Roadster assembly operations at our Menlo Park facility.
California Air Resources Board’s Zero Emissions Vehicle Program
In connection with the delivery and placement into service of our zero emission vehicles in a number of states, we have earned and will continue to earn tradable credits that can be sold. Under California’s Low-Emission Vehicle Regulations, and similar laws in other states, vehicle manufacturers are required to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. Currently, the states of California, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont have such laws in effect. These laws provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we earn ZEV credits on each vehicle sold in such states and have entered into agreements with other automobile manufacturers to sell the ZEV credits that we earn.
We have entered into two contracts for the sale of ZEV credits. For the year ended December 31, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we earned revenue from the sale of ZEV credits of $3.5 million and $7.6 million, respectively. Our current agreement provides for the sale of the ZEV credits that we earn from the sale of vehicles that we manufactured between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2009, and we have until June 30, 2010 to sell these ZEV credits under the agreement. We are currently negotiating to extend this agreement for vehicles manufactured in 2010 and 2011. As of December 31, 2009, we had sold credits for 340 vehicles under this agreement. We previously had an agreement with a different buyer for our ZEV credits earned during the year ended December 31, 2008.

Federal and State Incentives in the United States
As of December 31, 2009, incentives in the United States include:
United States Federal Tax Credits
The Qualified Plug-In Electric Drive Motor Vehicle Tax Credit program instituted by the United States federal government provides a tax credit of up to $7,500 for the purchase of new qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicles. This credit applies to the first 200,000 vehicles sold per manufacturer. Purchasers of the Tesla Roadster are currently eligible for a tax credit under this program of $7,500. To the extent such program is still in effect when the Model S is available for purchase, we expect purchasers of the Model S to also be eligible for a $7,500 tax credit under this program. In addition, the Alternative Fuel Infrastructure Tax Credit provides for tax credits for businesses up to 50% of the cost of installing alternative fueling equipment, not to exceed $50,000. Consumers who purchase residential fueling equipment but are not eligible to depreciate such equipment may receive a tax credit of up to $2,000. The program includes electricity as an alternative fuel and potentially can be used by Tesla customers to offset the cost of their home charging systems and by businesses to offset the costs of installing electric vehicle charging stations. These credits will expire on December 31, 2010.
State Incentives
A number of states and municipalities in the United States, as well as certain private enterprises, offer incentive programs to encourage the adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, including tax exemptions, tax credits, exemptions, and special privileges. For example, New Jersey and Washington exempt the purchase of electric vehicles from state sales tax. Other states, including Colorado, Oregon, Georgia and Oklahoma, provide for substantial state tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles. In California several utilities offer reduced electricity rates for the purpose of charging electric vehicles. As of December 1, 2009, the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, for example, offered an off-peak discount of approximately 50% off of the regular residential electricity rate for electricity used to charge electric vehicles. Similar programs exist with Southern California Edison and other utility companies. Municipalities in California also offer parking incentives for electric vehicles which include free or reduced fee parking in major metropolitan areas.
CAFE Standards and Credits
In 2009, the United States federal government proposed a new national program to raise and accelerate the current Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards and to establish new national greenhouse gas emissions standards under the Clean Air Act. Under the new CAFE proposal, manufacturers’ passenger vehicle fleets must achieve a combined average fuel economy standard of 34.1 mpg by 2016, a significant increase over current standards. Financial penalties exist for non-compliance. The proposed new CAFE standards will also advance the fuel economy target levels four years earlier than required under previous law, which required average fuel economy of 35 mpg by 2020. Furthermore, this new program will allow automakers the flexibility to earn CAFE credits by exceeding the standard in a given model year, and they can either apply those credits to shortfalls in future years or trade them to another automaker. The Obama administration suggested in November 2009 that automakers be given CAFE credits that would let low and zero emission vehicles count for up to two cars when annual fleet fuel efficiency averages are calculated. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, and the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, are jointly developing final rules to implement the new CAFE standards. In 2009, NHTSA adopted regulations that permit the transfer and trading of CAFE credits earned from vehicles with model years later than 2010.

Incentives in Europe
As of December 31, 2009, incentives in Europe include:
E.U. Emissions Regulations
We believe Europe has a regulatory environment that is generally conducive to the development, production and sale of small, alternative fuel vehicles. Through emission legislation, tax incentives and direct subsidies, the European Union is taking a progressive stance in reducing carbon emissions and increasing demand for electric vehicles. In 2007, The European Commission instituted regulations targeting average new vehicle emissions of approximately 19% below 2007 levels. These regulations begin in 2012 and will affect 65% of new vehicle sales and phase in to 100% by 2015. The penalties imposed by this legislation on manufacturers that exceed target levels will rise over time, from €20 per vehicle in 2012 to €95 per vehicle in 2015.
Consumer Incentives
In addition to a favorable regulatory environment, European countries have announced attractive combinations of subsidies and tax incentives. For example, the United Kingdom has announced a plan for up to £5,000 in support of electric vehicles and France has proposed €5,000 in direct subsidies for electric vehicle purchases through 2012. Additionally, a number of European countries are shifting their registration tax regime to a carbon dioxide-based system which typically reduces or eliminates annual registration taxes for electric vehicles due to their zero emissions profile. Certain European countries such as Norway have also adopted significant tax incentives for individuals to purchase electric vehicles. For example, in Norway, an owner of a vehicle similar to the Tesla Roadster in terms of performance but powered by an internal combustion engine would be required to pay a one-time registration tax, while an owner of a electric vehicle such as the Tesla Roadster would not be required to pay such registration tax.
Regulation—Vehicle Safety and Testing
Our vehicles are subject to, and the Tesla Roadster complies with, or is exempt from, numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or the NHTSA, including all applicable United States federal motor vehicle safety standards, or the FMVSS. As a manufacturer we must self-certify that a vehicle meets or is exempt from all applicable FMVSSs, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, before the vehicle can be imported into or sold in the United States.
There are numerous FMVSSs that apply to our vehicles. Examples of these requirements include:
 
 	•	 	
Crash-worthiness requirements—including applicable and appropriate level of vehicle structure and occupant protection in frontal, side and interior impacts including through use of equipment such as seat belts and airbags which must satisfy applicable requirements;

 
 	•	 	
Crash avoidance requirements—including appropriate steering, braking, electronic stability control, and equipment requirements, such as, headlamps, tail lamps, and other required lamps, all of which must conform to various photometric and performance requirements;

 
 	•	 	
Electric vehicle requirements—limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention, and avoidance of electric shock following specified crash tests;

 
 	•	 	
Windshield defrosting and defogging—defined zones of the windshield must be cleared within a specified timeframe; and

 
 	•	 	
Rearview mirror requirements—rearward areas that must be visible to the driver via the mirrors.

Several FMVSS regulations that NHTSA has promulgated or amended recently contain phase-in provisions requiring increasing percentages of a manufacturer’s vehicles to comply over a period of several model years.
 
114
Table of Contents

Those FMVSSs generally allow low volume manufacturers (those who manufacture fewer than 5,000 vehicles annually for sale in the United States) and limited line manufacturers (those who sell three or fewer vehicle lines in the United States) to defer compliance until the end of the phase-in period. We currently qualify as both a low volume manufacturer and a limited line manufacturer, and as a result, we are currently exempt from certain requirements, such as some new advanced airbag requirements, the advanced side impact requirements, and certain electronic stability control requirements, until the end of the applicable phase-in periods. In addition, we have applied for, and have been granted, an exemption from certain other advanced air bag requirements, which applies to Tesla Roadsters manufactured through January 28, 2011. We intend to request an extension of such exemption for Tesla Roadsters manufactured after such date. Under U.S. law, we are required to certify compliance with all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards and we have done so with respect to each vehicle we have offered for sale in the U.S. Based on testing, engineering analysis, and other information, we have certified that the Tesla Roadster complies or is exempt from all applicable NHTSA standards by affixing a certification label to each Tesla Roadster sold.
We are also required to comply with other NHTSA requirements of federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, consumer information labeling requirements, early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner’s manual requirements.
Our vehicles sold in Europe are subject to European Union safety testing regulations. Many of those regulations, referred to as European Union Whole Vehicle Type Approval, or WVTA, are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. Our Tesla Roadsters are currently approved for sale on a limited basis in the European Union via the Small Series WVTA, which permits the manufacture and sale in the European Union of no more than 1,000 vehicles per year. We plan to keep European sales of our Tesla Roadsters at less than 1,000 vehicles per year, and have no plans to commence testing our Tesla Roadsters for the WVTA to assure compliance with the European Union requirements to permit unlimited sales. Similarly, Australia and Japan have additional testing regulations applicable to high volume manufacturers. We also plan to keep Australian and Japanese sales of our Tesla Roadsters at a low volume, and have no plans to comply with the Australian and Japanese requirements to permit high volume sales in these jurisdictions. In connection with the planned introduction of the Tesla Roadster in Australia and Japan, we conducted a frontal impact test based on European Union testing standards on the Tesla Roadster in November 2009, which is required for sales exceeding certain annual volumes outside the United States. While the Tesla Roadster met most of the criteria for occupant protection and all criteria for high voltage safety in the front impact crash test, there were two criteria that were not met in the test. Based on our analysis of additional compliance options in Australia and Japan, we believe such an outcome should not limit our ability to sell the Tesla Roadster in Australia below certain annual volumes or, subject to compliance with certain Japanese import rules, have a material impact on our ability to sell Tesla Roadsters in Japan.
The Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, requires us to calculate and display the range of our electric vehicles on a label we affix to the vehicle’s window. The FTC specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers, or SAE, which further requires that we test using the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s, or EPA’s combined city and highway testing cycles. The EPA announced in November 2009 that it would develop and establish new energy efficiency testing methodologies for electric vehicles. Based on initial indications from the EPA, we believe it is likely that the EPA will modify its testing cycles in a manner that, when applied to our vehicles, could reduce the advertised range of our vehicles by up to 30% as compared to the combined two-cycle test currently applicable to our vehicles. However, there can be no assurance that the modified EPA testing cycles will not result in a greater reduction. To the extent that the FTC adopts these procedures in place of the current procedures from the SAE, this could impair our ability to advertise the Tesla Roadster as a vehicle that is capable of going in excess of 200 miles. Moreover, such changes could impair our ability to deliver the Model S with the initially advertised range, which could result in the cancellation of a number of the approximately 2,000 reservations that have been placed for the Model S.
 
115
Table of Contents

Although the real life customer experience of the range of our electric vehicles will not change due to the changes in the FTC or EPA standards, the reduction in the advertised range could negatively impact our sales and harm our business.
The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act requires manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, the Act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as determined by EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration if such tests are conducted. As a manufacturer of only electric vehicles, compliance with the EPA labeling requirements on fuel economy is currently optional for us.
Regulation—EPA Emissions & Certificate of Conformity
The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, with respect to emissions for our vehicles. The Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and the Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles.
Manufacturers who sell vehicles in states covered by federal requirements under the Clean Air Act without a Certificate of Conformity may be subject to penalties of up to $37,500 per violation and be required to recall and remedy any vehicles sold with emissions in excess of Clean Air Act standards. We received a Certificate of Conformity for sales of our Tesla Roadsters in 2008, but did not receive a Certificate of Conformity for sales of the Tesla Roadster in 2009 until December 21, 2009. This Certificate of Conformity covered sales of Tesla Roadsters from December 21, 2009 through December 31, 2009.
The EPA’s Self-Audit Policy allows companies to self-report violations of federal environmental laws and thereby mitigate potential penalties. We reported the failure to obtain a Certificate of Conformity for 2009 to the EPA on December 20, 2009. In January 2010, we and the EPA entered into an Administrative Settlement Agreement and Audit Policy Determination in which we agreed to pay a civil administrative penalty in the sum of $275,000. The EPA agreed to treat any 2009 Tesla Roadsters sold prior to December 21, 2009 as if they were covered by a valid Certificate of Conformity based on our agreement to treat these vehicles as if they had been certified when sold for emissions and emissions warranty purposes. Prior to obtaining the Certificate of Conformity on December 21, 2009, we sold 637 vehicles in 2009 in states where such a certificate is required for such sales. The EPA has closed the matter and we have been notified that it considers the violations resolved as of January 2010. All Tesla Roadsters we sold prior to obtaining the Certificate of Conformity in 2009 are now considered lawfully sold for purposes of the Clean Air Act with no impediments to further registration, use or subsequent sale. We received a Certificate of Conformity for the sales of model year 2010 Tesla Roadsters on December 31, 2009.
Regulation—Battery Safety and Testing
Our battery pack conforms with mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods,” which includes lithium-ion batteries, that may present a risk in transportation. The governing regulations, which are issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations, and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of transportation when these items are shipped such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck, or by air.
 
116
Table of Contents

We have completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs demonstrating our compliance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, including:
 
 	•	 	
Altitude simulation—simulating air transport;

 
 	•	 	
Thermal cycling—assessing cell and battery seal integrity;

 
 	•	 	
Vibration—simulating vibration during transport;

 
 	•	 	
Shock—simulating possible impacts during transport;

 
 	•	 	
External short circuit—simulating an external short circuit; and

 
 	•	 	
Overcharge—evaluating the ability of a rechargeable battery to withstand overcharging (this test was performed on the battery pack we provided for Daimler’s Smart fortwo vehicle but was not performed on the battery pack for the Tesla Roadster).

The cells in our battery packs are composed mainly of lithium metal oxides. The cells do not contain any lead, mercury, cadmium, or other hazardous materials, heavy metals, or any toxic materials.
In addition, our battery packs include packaging for the lithium-ion cells. This packaging includes trace amounts of various hazardous chemicals whose use, storage and disposal is regulated under federal law.
Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
State law regulates the manufacture, distribution and sale of automobiles, and generally requires motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed. We are registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in the states of California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois and Washington, and we are licensed as a motor vehicle dealer in the state of New York.
To the extent possible, we plan to secure dealer licenses and engage in activities as a motor vehicle dealer in other states as appropriate and necessary as we open additional Tesla stores. Some states, such as Texas, do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, to the extent permitted by local law, both the actual sale and all activities related to the sale would generally have to occur out of state. In this scenario, it is possible that activities related to marketing, advertising, taking orders, taking reservations and reservation payments, and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state’s motor vehicle industry laws. Regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and, in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers, may otherwise prohibit or impact our planned activities.
In jurisdictions where we do not have a Tesla store, a customer may try to purchase our vehicles over the internet. However, some states, such as Kansas, have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of Kansas in order to sell vehicles to Kansas residents. Such laws may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state before we sell vehicles to residents of such states. In some states where we have opened a viewing “gallery” that is not a full retail location, it is possible that a state regulator could take the position that activities at our gallery constitute an unlicensed motor vehicle dealership and thereby violates applicable manufacturer-dealer laws. For example, the state of Colorado required us to obtain dealer and manufacturer licenses in the state in order to operate our gallery in Colorado. Although we would prefer that a state regulator address any concerns of this nature by discussing such concerns with us and requesting voluntary compliance, a state could also take action against us, including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities at that location. In addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states where we do not maintain service facilities.
 
117
Table of Contents

The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state.
California laws, and potentially the laws of other states, restrict the ability of licensed dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles before they are available. In November 2007, we became aware that the New Motor Vehicle Board of the California Department of Transportation has considered whether our reservation and advertising policies comply with these laws. To date, we have not received any communications on this topic from the New Motor Vehicle Board or the Department of Motor Vehicles, or DMV, which has the power to enforce these laws. There can be no assurance that the DMV will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law. We expect that if the DMV determines that we may have violated the law, it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance. If we are ultimately found to be in violation of California law, we might be precluded from taking reservation payments, and the DMV could take other actions against us, including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments. Resolution of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program. The DMV also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in California, following a hearing on the merits, which it has typically exercised only in cases of significant or repeat violations and/or a refusal to comply with DMV directions.
Certain states may have specific laws which apply to dealers, or manufacturers selling directly to consumers, or both. For example, the state of Washington requires that reservation payments or other payment received from residents in the state of Washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle, which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer. Consequently, we established a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of Washington in January 2010. There can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payment received from customers. Our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity.
Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time.
In addition to licensing laws, specific laws and regulations in each of the states (and their interpretation by regulators) may limit or determine how we sell, market, advertise, and otherwise solicit sales, take orders, take reservations and reservation payments, deliver, and service vehicles for consumers and engage in other activities in that state. While we have performed an analysis of laws in certain jurisdictions in which we have Tesla stores, we have not performed a complete analysis in all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices.

Competition
Competition in the automotive industry is intense and evolving. We believe the impact of new regulatory requirements for occupant safety and vehicle emissions, technological advances in powertrain and consumer electronics components, and shifting customer needs and expectations are causing the industry to evolve in the direction of electric-based vehicles. We believe the primary competitive factors in our markets are:
 
 	•	 	
technological innovation;

 
 	•	 	
product quality and safety;

 
 	•	 	
service options;

 
 	•	 	
product performance;

 
 	•	 	
design and styling;

 
 	•	 	
product price; and

 
 	•	 	
manufacturing efficiency.

We believe that our vehicles compete in both the market based on their traditional segment classification as well as the market based on their propulsion technology. Within the electric-based vehicle segment, there are three primary means of powertrain electrification which will differentiate various competitors in this market:
 
 	•	 	
Electric Vehicles are vehicles powered completely by a single on-board energy storage system (battery pack or fuel cell) which is refueled directly from an electricity source. Both the Tesla Roadster and the Model S are examples of electric vehicles.

 
 	•	 	
Plug-in Hybrid Vehicles are vehicles powered by both a battery pack with an electric motor and an internal combustion engine which can be refueled both with traditional petroleum fuels for the engine and electricity for the battery pack. The internal combustion engine can either work in parallel with the electric motor to power the wheels, such as in a parallel plug-in hybrid vehicle, or be used only to recharge the battery, such as in a series plug-in hybrid vehicle like the Chevrolet Volt.

 
 	•	 	
Hybrid Electric Vehicles are vehicles powered by both a battery pack with an electric motor and an internal combustion engine but which can only be refueled with traditional petroleum fuels as the battery pack is charged via regenerative braking, such as used in a hybrid electric vehicle like the Toyota Prius.

The worldwide automotive market, particularly for alternative fuel vehicles, is highly competitive today and we expect it will become even more so in the future. As of December 31, 2009, no mass produced performance highway-capable electric vehicles were being sold in the United States or Europe. However, we expect competitors to enter these markets within the next several years, with some entering as early as the end of 2010, and as they do so, we expect that we will experience significant competition. With respect to our Tesla Roadster, we currently face strong competition from established automobile manufacturers, including manufacturers of high-performance vehicles, such as Porsche and Ferrari. In addition, upon the launch of our Model S sedan, we will face competition from existing and future automobile manufacturers in the extremely competitive luxury sedan market, including Audi, BMW, Lexus and Mercedes.
Many established and new automobile manufacturers have entered or have announced plans to enter the alternative fuel vehicle market. For example, Nissan has announced that it is developing the Nissan Leaf, a fully electric vehicle, which it plans to bring to market in late 2010. BYD Auto has also announced plans to bring an electric vehicle into United States market in 2010 and Ford has announced that it plans to introduce an electric vehicle in 2011. In addition, General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles. For example, General Motors has announced that it is developing the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates

purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery. General Motors announced that it plans to begin selling the Chevrolet Volt in 2010.
Moreover, it has been reported that Daimler, Lexus, Audi, Renault, Mitsubishi and Subaru are also developing electric vehicles. Several new start-ups have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles, although none of these have yet come to market. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries and we expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well.
Most of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing and other resources than we do and may be able to devote greater resources to the design, development, manufacturing, distribution, promotion, sale and support of their products. Virtually all of our competitors have more extensive customer bases and broader customer and industry relationships than we do. In addition, almost all of these companies have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do. Our competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new technologies and may be able to design, develop, market and sell their products more effectively. We believe our exclusive focus on electric vehicles and electric vehicle components, as well as our history of vehicle development and production, are the basis on which we can compete in the global automotive market in spite of the challenges posed by our competition.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology. As of December 31, 2009 we have 8 issued patents and 89 pending patent applications with the United States Patent and Trademark Office as well as numerous foreign patent application filings in a broad range of areas related to our powertrain. Our issued patents start expiring in 2026. We intend to continue to file additional patent applications with respect to our technology. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide us with protection.

This location will also serve as our production facility for the electric vehicle components we utilize in the Tesla Roadster and for our powertrain component and systems business.
We anticipate that the build out of both our Palo Alto facility and our planned Model S manufacturing facility will be partially-financed by our DOE Loan Facility.
We currently intend to add new facilities or expand our existing facilities as we add employees and expand our production organization. We believe that suitable additional or alternative space will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms to accommodate our foreseeable future expansion.
Legal Proceedings
From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.

Codes of Ethics
We expect our board of directors to adopt a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that will apply to all of our employees, officers, and directors, including our chief executive officer, chief financial officer and other principal executive and senior financial officers.
Board of Directors
Our board of directors currently consists of eight members. Our bylaws permit our board of directors to establish by resolution the authorized number of directors, and eleven directors are currently authorized.
As of the closing of this offering, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws will provide for a classified board of directors consisting of three classes of directors, each serving staggered three-year terms, as follows:
 
 	•	 	
the Class I directors will be Elon Musk, Stephen T. Jurvetson, and Herbert Kohler, and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2011;

 
 	•	 	
the Class II directors will be H.E. Ahmed Saif Al Darmaki, Antonio J. Gracias, and Kimbal Musk, and their terms will expire at the annual meeting of stockholders to be held in 2012; and

Upon expiration of the term of a class of directors, directors for that class will be elected for three-year terms at the annual meeting of stockholders in the year in which that term expires. Each director’s term continues until the election and qualification of his successor, or his earlier death, resignation or removal. Any increase or decrease in the number of directors will be distributed among the three classes so that, as nearly as possible, each class will consist of one-third of the directors. This classification of our board of directors may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control of our company.

Director Independence
Upon the completion of this offering, our common stock will be listed on            . Under the rules of           , independent directors must comprise a majority of a listed company’s board of directors within a specified period of the completion of this offering. In addition, the rules of             require that, subject to specified exceptions, each member of a listed company’s audit, compensation and nominating and governance committees be independent. Audit committee members must also satisfy the independence criteria set forth in Rule 10A-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Under the rules of            , a director will only qualify as an “independent director” if, in the opinion of that company’s board of directors, that person does not have a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director.
In order to be considered to be independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3, a member of an audit committee of a listed company may not, other than in his or her capacity as a member of the audit committee, the board of directors, or any other board committee: (1) accept, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fee from the listed company or any of its subsidiaries; or (2) be an affiliated person of the listed company or any of its subsidiaries.
In December 2009, our board of directors undertook a review of its composition, the composition of its committees and the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our board of directors has determined that none of Messrs. Al Darmaki, Buss, Ehrenpreis, Gracias and Jurvetson, representing five of our eight directors, has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is “independent” as that term is defined under the rules of             . Our board of directors also determined that Messrs. Buss, Gracias and Jurvetson, who comprise our audit committee, Messrs. Buss, Ehrenpreis and Gracias who comprise our compensation committee, and Messrs. Buss and Ehrenpreis, who comprise our nominating and governance committee, satisfy the independence standards for those committees established by applicable SEC rules and the rules of             . In making this determination, our board of directors considered the relationships that each non-employee director has with our company and all other facts and circumstances our board of directors deemed relevant in determining their independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each non-employee director.

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION
Compensation Discussion and Analysis
The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers for 2009 and 2010 should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current considerations, expectations, and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from current or planned programs as summarized in this discussion.
Compensation Philosophy—Introduction
We design, manufacture and sell high-performance electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle powertrain components. To achieve these goals, we designed, and intend to modify as necessary, our compensation and benefits program and philosophy, to attract, retain and incentivize talented, deeply qualified, and committed executive officers that share our philosophy and desire to work toward these goals. We believe compensation incentives for such executive officers should promote the success of our company and motivate them to pursue corporate objectives, and above all should be structured so as to reward clear, easily measured performance goals that closely align the executive officers’ incentives with the long-term interests of stockholders. To fulfill these goals, we are currently undertaking a comprehensive review and evaluation of all of our compensation programs, which we expect will continue throughout 2010.
In recent years, we have successfully navigated a wide variety of difficult operational and financial challenges and undergone several periods of rapid change that have directly affected the compensation structure of our executive team. The compensation offered to our senior executive officers has varied significantly as a result of these historical circumstances. Therefore, we will, as part of our evaluation of our compensation programs, seek to harmonize the compensation structures of senior executive officers and other employees to conform to our overall compensation philosophy.
Our current compensation programs reflect our startup origins in that they consist primarily of salary and stock options for senior executive officers. Consistent with our historical compensation philosophy, we do not currently provide our senior executive officers or other employees with any form of a cash bonus program, or, except as noted below, any severance provisions providing for continued salary or other benefits upon termination of an executive officer’s employment with us or other equity-based compensation, other than option grants. In certain limited cases, we have granted an executive up to 12 months vesting acceleration of certain stock options in the event of a termination of employment following a change of control. As a special dispensation to offset the risk to him associated with his relocation to California from Michigan and our strong desire to retain his talent and expertise, we also provided Deepak Ahuja, our Chief Financial Officer, the right to receive severance if he was terminated within the first 12 months of his employment. To date, we have not formally benchmarked our compensation program against any group of peer companies.
Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2009, we, primarily under the leadership of the Compensation Committee of our board of directors, began a comprehensive review of Chief Executive Officer, or CEO, compensation, director compensation, and executive compensation. The Compensation Committee retained Compensia, Inc., or Compensia, a compensation advisory firm, to provide data and consultation to the Compensation Committee in developing a systematic set of recommendations for CEO, director, and executive compensation. The Compensation Committee, currently consisting of Messrs. Buss (who joined the Committee in November 2009), Ehrenpreis, and Gracias, initially reviewed and made recommendations to the full Board on CEO and director compensation as described below, and in collaboration with the CEO has begun a comprehensive review of executive compensation, to be continued and completed in 2010. We anticipate increasing the flexibility and elements of our compensation structure, while striving to maintain transparency, simplicity, and a clear pay for performance orientation.
 
129
Table of Contents

Additionally, as our needs evolve, we intend to continue to evaluate our philosophy and compensation programs as circumstances require, and at a minimum, we will review executive compensation annually. We anticipate making new equity awards and adjustments to the components of our executive compensation program in connection with our yearly compensation review, which will be based, in part, upon the market analysis performed by Compensia that may include benchmarking against a peer group of companies to be determined in the future and the recommendations to the Compensation Committee by our Chief Executive Officer.
Role of the Compensation Committee in Setting Executive Compensation
The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for recommending to our Board of Directors the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and determining the compensation of our other executive officers. Members of the Compensation Committee are appointed by the Board of Directors. Currently, the Compensation Committee consists of three members of the Board, Messrs. Buss, Ehrenpreis, and Gracias, none of whom are executive officers of the Company, and Messrs. Buss, Ehrenpreis and Gracias each qualify as (i) an “independent director” under the             listing standards, and (ii) an “outside director” under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). See the section entitled “Management—Committees of the Board of Directors—Compensation Committee.”
Role of Compensation Consultant
The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage the services of outside consultants to assist it making decisions regarding the establishment of the Company’s compensation programs and philosophy. The Compensation Committee retained Compensia as its compensation consultant in 2009 to advise the Compensation Committee in matters related to CEO compensation and director compensation. The Compensation Committee has begun, but not yet completed, its analysis of executive officer compensation for 2010, which may include recommendation from Compensia or another outside consultant. As of this filing, Compensia has assisted the Compensation Committee in determining appropriate equity grants to our CEO and non-employee director compensation.
Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions
For executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has historically sought and considered input from our Chief Executive Officer regarding such executive officers’ responsibilities, performance and compensation. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer recommends base salary increases and equity award levels that are used throughout our compensation plans, and advises the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation program’s ability to attract, retain and motivate executive talent. These recommendations reflect compensation levels that our Chief Executive Officer believes are qualitatively commensurate with an executive officer’s individual qualifications, experience, responsibility level, functional role, knowledge, skills, and individual performance, as well as our company’s performance. Our Compensation Committee considers our Chief Executive Officer’s recommendations, but may adjust up or down as it determines in its discretion, and approves the specific compensation for all the executive officers. Our Compensation Committee also relies on the experience of our directors affiliated with venture capital firms, which have representatives on the boards of numerous private companies, in determining and approving the specific compensation amounts. All such compensation determinations are largely discretionary.
Our Compensation Committee meets in executive session, and our Chief Executive Officer does not attend Compensation Committee discussions where recommendations are made regarding his compensation. He also abstains from voting in sessions of the Board of Directors where the Board of Directors acts on the Compensation Committee’s recommendations regarding his compensation.
Chief Executive Officer Compensation
In developing compensation recommendations for the Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought both to appropriately reward the Chief Executive Officer’s previous and current contributions and to
 
130
Table of Contents

create incentives for the Chief Executive Officer to continue to contribute significantly to successful results in the future. Our Chief Executive Officer, Elon Musk, has been working for an annual base salary of $33,280, during his tenure as our Chief Executive Officer in order to help us preserve our cash balances. Prior to December 2009, Mr. Musk also did not receive any equity compensation for his services. In addition to serving as the Chief Executive Officer since October 2008, Mr. Musk has contributed significantly and actively to us since our earliest days in April 2004 by recruiting executives and engineers, contributing to the Tesla Roadster’s engineering and design, raising capital for us and bringing investors to us, and raising public awareness of the Company. Further, Mr. Musk has served, and continues to serve, as our Chief Product Architect.
As part of its review, the Compensation Committee requested summary data from Compensia concerning ranges of compensatory equity ownership levels as a percentage of the company by Chief Executive Officers who have played a significant role in the founding and early stage growth of technology companies. This review included an assessment of founder ownership data in late-stage, pre-IPO companies of similar size and capital to us and founder ownership data of a broad sampling of technology companies at the time of the IPO. The data presented to the Compensation Committee by Compensia analyzed the total beneficial ownership of founder CEOs immediately prior to the IPO. It was noted that the vast majority of these CEOs acquired their equity through compensatory equity grants as opposed to preferred stock acquired via investment.
Based on its judgment, a review of competitive market ownership data, and its view that compensation should be tied to clear, measurable performance goals that would best align Mr. Musk with stockholder interests, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board adopted in December 2009, a compensation approach for Mr. Musk, which provides compensation primarily through stock options designed to promote long-term stockholder interests.
Among the accomplishments achieved during Mr. Musk’s involvement with us that the Compensation Committee felt deserved recognition, the Compensation Committee considered our successful launch of the Tesla Roadster in 2008, the extension of sales to Europe in 2009, our early success in building a well-recognized worldwide brand, and our success in fundraising during the 2008-2009 time period, when despite difficult external conditions, we raised equity financing and entered into the DOE Loan Facility, together totaling more than $500 million.
In recognition of these achievements and to create incentives for future success, the Compensation Committee recommended, and the Board of Directors approved a grant to Mr. Musk of 10,067,960 options to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.21 per share representing 4% of our fully-diluted share base as of December 4, 2009, with  1/4th of the shares subject to the option vesting immediately, and  1/48th of the shares subject to the option scheduled to vest each month thereafter over the next three years, assuming Mr. Musk’s continued service to us through each vesting date.
In addition, to create incentives for the attainment of clear performance objectives around a key element of our current business plan—the successful launch and commercialization of the Model S—the Compensation Committee recommended and the Board of Directors approved on December 4, 2009, an additional grant to Mr. Musk of 10,067,960 options to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $2.21 per share totaling an additional 4% of our fully-diluted shares as of December 4, 2009, with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of performance objectives as follows, assuming Mr. Musk’s continued service to us through each vesting date:
 
 	•	 	
 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the successful completion of the Model S Engineering Prototype;

 
 	•	 	
 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the successful completion of the Model S Vehicle Prototype;

 
 	•	 	
 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the completion of the first Model S Production Vehicle; and

 
131
Table of Contents

 	•	 	
 1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the completion of 10,000th Model S Production Vehicle.

The milestones for this option award were designed to reward Mr. Musk for company-based performance goals that align Mr. Musk’s compensation with the long-term interests of stockholders and the United States Department of Energy. The milestones were set at levels that are attainable and critical to our success. If Mr. Musk does not meet one or more of the above milestones prior to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant he will forfeit his right to the unvested portion of the option.
Executive Officer Compensation
Historically, our Chief Executive Officer has made recommendations to our Board of Directors and Compensation Committee regarding compensation for other executive officers and our Board and Compensation Committee have generally adopted the Chief Executive Officer’s recommendations.
As indicated above, our Compensation Committee has begun to develop an overall set of compensation recommendations for our executive officers. However, the process is ongoing and is expected to be completed during calendar year 2010. Goals of the review include:
 
 	•	 	
Establishing a compensation program structure to attract and retain the most highly qualified executive officers.

 
 	•	 	
Developing compensation guiding principles, including a comparative peer group and targeted market positioning for different compensation elements.

 
 	•	 	
Harmonizing salary, equity awards, and other compensation benefits for executive officers hired under significantly different circumstances.

 
 	•	 	
Continuing to align executive officer compensation, both in individual cases and as a team, to the long-term interests of stockholders.

 
 	•	 	
Developing a flexibility that permits the accommodation of appropriate individual circumstances.

 
 	•	 	
Emphasizing clear, easily-measured performance goals to help align executive officer compensation with the long-term interests of stockholders.

In the third quarter of 2009, we completed performance reviews for our employees and executive officers, and in some cases as a result of these reviews, executive officers received additional stock option grants. The grants were recommended in the third quarter, and granted in the fourth quarter. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2009, based on recommendations from our CEO to the Compensation Committee, the Compensation Committee reviewed certain officers’ overall contribution and recommended additional equity option grants as a first step in modifying Executive Officer compensation—especially those with longer tenures with us—consistent with the goals above. The following table sets forth the stock option grants we made to our named executive officers in the third and fourth quarters of 2009:

The review of executive compensation is ongoing, and the Compensation Committee, Chief Executive Officer, and Board of Directors anticipate additional modifications in 2010 as a result of aligning executive compensation with the goals described above.
Elements of Compensation
Our current executive compensation program, which was set by our Compensation Committee, consists of the following components:
 
 	•	 	
base salary;

 
 	•	 	
equity-based incentives;

 
 	•	 	
severance and change of control benefits; and

 
 	•	 	
other benefits.

We combine these elements in order to formulate compensation packages that provide competitive pay, reward achievement of financial, operational and strategic objectives and align the interests of our named executive officers and other senior personnel with those of our stockholders.

Base Salary
We provide base salary to our named executive officers and other employees to compensate them for services rendered on a day-to-day basis during the fiscal year. The following table sets forth information regarding the base salary for fiscal year 2009 and 2010 for our named executive officers:

  	325,000	  	 	—  
Jon Sobel(5)

  	300,000	  	 	—  
 
(1)	Mr. Musk’s salary is based on the minimum wage requirements for executive officers in the State of California and he is subject to income taxes based on such base salary. Mr. Musk, however, currently only accepts $1 per year for his services. Under California law, Mr. Musk is entitled to the portion of the base salary that he does not receive each year.
(2)	Mr. Ahuja’s base salary was increased from $275,000 to $300,000 effective August 1, 2009.
(3)	Mr. Straubel’s base salary was increased from $185,000 to $205,000 effective August 1, 2009.
(4)	Mr. Donoughe resigned as our Executive Vice President, Vehicle Engineering and Manufacturing in September 2009, although he remained employed on a leave of absence basis through December 31, 2009.
(5)	Mr. Sobel resigned as our General Counsel in December 2009.
Prior to this offering, our Chief Executive Officer has been responsible for setting other executives’ base salaries and our Board of Directors has been responsible for setting the CEO’s base salary. Base salaries for certain of our executive officers were increased during 2009 to award them for individual past performance.
Equity-based incentives
Our equity award program is the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our named executive officers. Our equity-based incentives have historically been granted in the form of options to purchase shares of our common stock, including the grant of options at the commencement of employment for the majority of our current named executive officers. We believe that equity grants align the interests of our named executive officers with our stockholders, provide our named executive officers with incentives linked to long-term performance and create an ownership culture. In addition, the vesting feature of our equity grants contributes to executive retention because this feature provides an incentive to our named executive officers to remain in our employ during the vesting period. To date, we have not had an established set of criteria for granting equity awards; instead the Compensation Committee exercised its judgment and discretion, in consultation with our CEO, and considered, among other things, the role and responsibility of the named executive officer, competitive factors, the amount of stock-based equity compensation already held by the named executive officer, and the cash-based compensation received by the named executive officer to determine its recommendations for equity awards, which it then provided to our Board of Directors for approval.
We do not have, nor do we plan to establish, any program, plan, or practice to time stock option grants in coordination with releasing material non-public information.
Severance and Change of Control Benefits
We entered into offer letters and other agreements that require specific payments and benefits to be provided to our named executive officers in the event of termination of employment in connection with a change of control. See “Executive Compensation—Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Potential Payments Upon Change of Control.”

Table of Contents

Bonus
We currently do not provide any cash-based bonus awards to our named executive officers.
Perks
We generally do not provide any additional perquisites to our named executive officers except in certain limited circumstances. For example, we entered into a relocation agreement with Deepak Ahuja, our Chief Financial Officer, to reimburse him for certain relocation expenses. See “Executive Compensation—Offer Letters and Change of Control Agreements.” Additionally we agreed to reimburse John Walker, our Vice President, North America Sales & Marketing, for temporary living expenses for a six-month period from August 17, 2009 through February 17, 2010, up to a maximum with $4,000 per month for temporary housing and incidental expenses, including a full gross up for any tax liability incurred with respect to the reimbursements.
Benefits
We provide the following benefits to our named executive officers on the same basis provided to all of our employees:
 
 	•	 	
health, dental and vision insurance;

 
 	•	 	
life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance;

 
 	•	 	
a 401(k) plan;

 
 	•	 	
employee assistance plan;

 
 	•	 	
short-and long-term disability;

 
 	•	 	
medical and dependent care flexible spending account; and

 
 	•	 	
a health savings account.

Tax Considerations
We have not provided any executive officer or director with a gross-up or other reimbursement for tax amounts the executive might pay pursuant to Section 280G or Section 409A of the Code. Section 280G and related Code sections provide that executive officers, directors who hold significant stockholder interests and certain other service providers could be subject to significant additional taxes if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control of us that exceeds certain limits, and that we or our successor could lose a deduction on the amounts subject to the additional tax. Section 409A also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that an executive officer, director or service provider receives “deferred compensation” that does not meet the requirements of Section 409A.
Because of the limitations of Internal Revenue Code Section 162(m), we generally receive a federal income tax deduction for compensation paid to our chief executive officer and to certain other highly compensated officers only if the compensation is less than $1,000,000 per person during any fiscal year or is “performance- based” under Code Section 162(m). In addition to salary and bonus compensation, upon the exercise of stock options that are not treated as incentive stock options, the excess of the current market price over the option price, or option spread, is treated as compensation and accordingly, in any year, such exercise may cause an officer’s total compensation to exceed $1,000,000. Option spread compensation from options that meet certain requirements will not be subject to the $1,000,000 cap on deductibility, and in the past we have granted options that we believe met those requirements. Additionally, under a special Code Section 162(m) exception, any compensation paid pursuant to a compensation plan in existence before the effective date of this public offering will not be subject to the $1,000,000 limitation until the earliest of: (i) the expiration of the compensation plan, (ii) a material modification of the compensation plan (as determined under Code Section 162(m), (iii) the issuance of all the employer stock and other compensation allocated under the compensation plan, or (iv) the first

Table of Contents

meeting of stockholders at which directors are elected after the close of the third calendar year following the year in which the public offering occurs. While the Compensation Committee cannot predict how the deductibility limit may impact our compensation program in future years, the Compensation Committee intends to maintain an approach to executive compensation that strongly links pay to performance. In addition, while the Compensation Committee has not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our named executive officers, the Compensation Committee intends to consider tax deductibility under Code Section 162(m) as a factor in compensation decisions.
Summary Compensation Table
The following table provides information regarding the compensation of our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, and each of the next three most highly compensated executive officers during our year ended December 31, 2009.

Mr. Ahuja’s current annual base salary is $300,000. In addition, Mr. Ahuja received options to purchase 250,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share of $0.90, which was equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date the options were granted as determined by our board of directors.

The offer letter agreement also provides that if we terminated Mr. Ahuja without cause within 12 months of his employment start date we would continue to pay Mr. Ahuja his salary until the earlier of his commencing suitable employment with another firm or six months from the date of his termination.
On October 31, 2008, we entered into a relocation agreement with Mr. Ahuja, which superseded the offer letter agreement with respect to all relocation benefits provided under the offer letter agreement. The relocation agreement provided for the reimbursement of up to $5,000 per month for rent payments for a residence for Mr. Ahuja and his family for one year. This reimbursement benefit was extended by amendment through December 31, 2009. The relocation agreement provided for the reimbursement of any sales commissions and closing costs for the sale of Mr. Ahuja’s residence in Michigan, not in excess of $70,000, provided that if Mr. Ahuja voluntarily terminated his employment with us at any time within 18 months of his employment start date then Mr. Ahuja would repay all such reimbursements related to the sale of his residence. The relocation agreement further provided for the reimbursement of reasonable costs of transporting Mr. Ahuja’s goods and personal effects and up to two cars, subject to the specific terms of the relocation agreement.
Jeffrey B. Straubel

We entered into an offer letter agreement with John Walker, our Vice President, United States Sales and Marketing, on August 17, 2009. The offer letter agreement has no specific term and constitutes at-will employment. Mr. Walker’s current annual base salary is $250,000 and he receives a bonus of $100 for each Tesla Roadster sold in North America. Mr. Walker is also eligible for other bonuses, as we may from time to time determine to award in our discretion. In addition, Mr. Walker received an option to purchase 250,000 shares of our common stock at an exercise price per share of $2.05, which was equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date the option was granted. Further, the offer letter agreement, as modified by a separate Relocation Agreement, provides for the reimbursement of temporary living and incidental expenses until Mr. Walker relocates his family to California of up to $4,000 per month for a maximum of six months. In addition, Mr. Walker will receive a full gross up for any additional taxes Mr. Walker incurs with respect to such reimbursement.
Gilbert Passin

Further, the offer letter agreement provides for a relocation package, including reimbursement of rental expenses incurred by Mr. Passin for a reasonable temporary apartment in Southern California for up to two years and reasonable travel costs from the Bay Area to Southern California related to the performance of services for the Company. The offer letter agreement also provides for reimbursement of all reasonable costs incurred in selling Mr. Passin’s current home, including legal and real estate selling costs, all of Mr. Passin’s costs with regard to packing, shipping and transport of Mr. Passin’s personal items to Southern California, and any actual legal, commission and incidental costs incurred in connection with buying a new home in Southern California.
Michael Donoughe
Mr. Donoughe ceased to be our Executive Vice President of Vehicle Engineering and Manufacturing in September 2009 although he remained employed on a leave of absence basis through December 31, 2009. He is no longer an employee of Tesla and, therefore, is not entitled to any benefits under his agreement with us following his termination of employment.
Jon Sobel
Mr. Sobel ceased to be our General Counsel in December 2009. He is not entitled to any benefits under his agreement with us following his termination of employment and he did not acquire any vested rights in the option granted as contemplated under his agreement.
Potential Payments Upon Change of Control
We entered into agreements that require specific payments and benefits to be provided to our named executive officers in the event of termination of employment in connection with a change of control. The description and tables that follow describe the payments and benefits which are owed by us to each of our named executive officers upon termination, excluding Mr. Sobel because his employment terminated prior to the end of fiscal 2009. The terms “Cause” and “Change of Control” have the meanings set forth in the relevant agreements.
Elon Musk
Assuming Mr. Musk’s employment terminated on December 31, 2009, by virtue of the agreements mentioned above, he would not be entitled to any benefits upon such termination.
Deepak Ahuja
Assuming Mr. Ahuja’s employment terminated on December 31, 2009, by virtue of the agreements mentioned above, he would be entitled to benefits with the value set forth in the table below:

Employee Benefit Plans
2003 Equity Incentive Plan
Our board of directors adopted, and our stockholders approved our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2003 Plan, in July 2003 and became effective upon approval by our stockholders. The 2003 Equity Incentive Plan was amended in December 2009. The purposes of the 2003 Plan are to secure and retain the services of persons eligible to receive awards under the 2003 Plan and to provide incentives for such persons to exert maximum efforts towards our success. Our 2003 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options to our employees and any of our parent and subsidiary corporations’ employees, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock bonuses and restricted stock to our employees, directors and consultants and our parent and subsidiary corporations’ employees and consultants. We will not grant any additional awards under our 2003 Plan following this offering and will instead grant awards under our 2009 Equity Incentive Plan. However, the 2003 Plan will continue to govern the terms and conditions of the outstanding awards previously granted thereunder.
Stock Subject to the Plan. The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2003 Plan is 42,238,740 shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2009, options to purchase 34,723,477 shares of our common stock were outstanding and 3,042,380 shares were available for future grant under the 2003 Plan.
If a stock option or other stock award expires or otherwise terminates without having been exercised in full, the unpurchased shares subject to such awards will become available for future grant or sale under the 2003 Plan, unless the plan has terminated.
Plan Administration. Our Board, or a committee that it appoints, administers the 2003 Plan. Subject to the provisions of our 2003 Plan, the administrator has the authority to determine the eligibility for awards and the terms, conditions and restrictions, including vesting terms, applicable to grants made under the 2003 Plan. The administrator also has the authority, subject to the terms of the 2003 Plan, to construe and interpret the 2003 Plan and awards, to amend outstanding awards and to establish, and amend and revoke rules and regulations it considers appropriate for the administration and interpretation of the 2003 Plan.
Stock Options. The administrator may grant incentive and/or nonstatutory stock options under our 2003 Plan; provided that incentive stock options are only granted to employees. The exercise price of incentive stock options within the meaning of Section 422 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or Code, must equal at least 100% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and the exercise price of
 
142
Table of Contents

nonstatutory stock options may not be less than 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The term of an option may not exceed ten years. Provided, however, that an incentive stock option held by a participant who owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock, or of certain of our parent or subsidiary corporations, may not have a term in excess of five years and must have an exercise price of at least 110% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The administrator will determine the methods of payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include cash, shares or other property acceptable to the plan administrator. Subject to the provisions of our 2003 Plan, the administrator determines the remaining terms of the options (e.g., vesting). After a participant’s termination of service, the participant may exercise his or her option, to the extent vested as of the date of termination, for a period of thirty days (or six months in the case of termination due to death or disability) following such termination, or such longer period of time specified in the individual option agreement. However, in no event may an option be exercised later than the expiration of its term.
Restricted Stock. Restricted stock awards are grants of rights to purchase our common stock that are subject to various restrictions, including restrictions on transferability and forfeiture provisions. After the administrator determines that it will offer restricted stock, it will advise the purchaser of the terms, conditions, and restrictions related to the grant, including the number of shares that the purchaser is entitled to purchase, the price to be paid, which generally may not be less than 85% of the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant, and the vesting schedule applicable to the award. A purchaser accepts the offer by execution of a restricted stock purchase agreement in the form determined by the administrator, which will set forth all the terms of the award.
Transferability of Awards. Our 2003 Plan generally does not allow for awards to be transferred in any manner other than by will or the laws of descent or distribution and may be exercised, during the lifetime of the participant, only by the participant; provided, however, Non-Employee Directors (as defined in the 2003 Plan) may freely transfer Nonstatutory Stock Options (as defined in the 2003 Plan) to either (i) their venture capital funds or (ii) their employers (or an affiliate, within the meaning of 424(e) or (f) of the Code, of a Non-Employee Director’s employer).
Certain Adjustments. If any change is made in our common stock subject to the 2003 Plan, or subject to any award thereunder, without the receipt of consideration by us, such as through a merger, consolidation, reorganization, recapitalization, reincorporation, stock dividend, dividend in property other than cash, stock split, liquidating dividend, combination of shares, exchange of shares, change in corporate structure or other transaction not involving the receipt of consideration by us, appropriate adjustments will be made in the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the plan and/or the number, class and price of shares covered by each outstanding award and the numerical share limits contained in the plan. In the event of our dissolution or liquidation, all outstanding awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction.
Corporate Transaction. In the event of (i) a sale, lease or other disposition of all or substantially all of our assets, (ii) a merger or consolidation in which we are not the surviving corporation or (iii) a reverse merger in which we are the surviving corporation but the shares of common stock outstanding immediately preceding the merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash or otherwise (individually, a “Corporate Transaction”), then any outstanding awards shall be assumed or substituted for by the surviving or acquiring corporation. If the surviving corporation or acquiring corporation refuses to assume or substitute for such awards, then with respect to awards held by participants whose continuous service has not terminated, the vesting of such awards (and, if applicable, the time during which such awards may be exercised) shall be accelerated in full, and the awards shall terminate if not exercised, if applicable, at or prior to the Corporate Transaction. With respect to any other awards outstanding under the plan, such awards shall terminate if not exercised, if applicable, prior to the Corporate Transaction.
Plan Termination and Amendment. Our board of directors may at any time amend, suspend or terminate the 2003 Plan, provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant. Our 2003 Plan will automatically terminate in 2013, unless we terminate it sooner.

2010 Equity Incentive Plan
Our board of directors has adopted, and we expect our stockholders will approve our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan, or the 2010 Plan, prior to the completion of this offering. Subject to stockholder approval, the 2010 Plan is effective upon its adoption by our board of directors, but is not expected to be utilized until after the completion of this offering. Our 2010 Plan provides for the grant of incentive stock options, within the meaning of Code Section 422, to our employees and any of our parent and subsidiary corporations’ employees, and for the grant of nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and consultants and our parent and subsidiary corporations’ employees and consultants.
Authorized Shares. The maximum aggregate number of shares that may be issued under the 2010 Plan is 32,000,000 shares of our common stock, plus (i) any shares that as of the completion of this offering, have been reserved but not issued pursuant to any awards granted under our 2003 Equity Incentive Plan and are not subject to any awards granted thereunder, and (ii) any shares subject to stock options or similar awards granted under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan that expire or otherwise terminate without having been exercised in full and unvested shares issued pursuant to awards granted under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan that are forfeited to or repurchased by us, with the maximum number of shares to be added to the 2010 Plan pursuant to clauses (i) and (ii) above equal to 35,042,380 shares as of December 31, 2009. In addition, the number of shares available for issuance under the 2010 Plan will be annually increased on the first day of each of our fiscal years beginning with the 2011 fiscal year, by an amount equal to the least of:
 
 	•	 	
16,000,000 shares;

 
 	•	 	
4% of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of the last day of our immediately preceding fiscal year; or

 
 	•	 	
such other amount as our board of directors may determine.

Shares issued pursuant to awards under the 2010 Plan that we repurchase or that are forfeited, as well as shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award, will become available for future grant under the 2010 Plan. In addition, to the extent that an award is paid out in cash rather than shares, such cash payment will not reduce the number of shares available for issuance under the 2010 Plan.
Plan Administration. The 2010 Plan will be administered by our board of directors which, at its discretion or as legally required, may delegate such administration to our compensation committee and/or one or more additional committees. In the case of awards intended to qualify as “performance-based compensation” within the meaning of Code Section 162(m), the committee will consist of two or more “outside directors” within the meaning of Code Section 162(m).
Subject to the provisions of our 2010 Plan, the administrator has the power to determine the terms of awards, including the recipients, the exercise price, if any, the number of shares subject to each award, the fair market value of a share of our common stock, the vesting schedule applicable to the awards, together with any vesting acceleration, and the form of consideration, if any, payable upon exercise of the award and the terms of the award agreement for use under the 2010 Plan. The administrator also has the authority, subject to the terms of the 2010 Plan, to amend existing awards to reduce or increase their exercise price, to allow participants the opportunity to transfer outstanding awards to a financial institution or other person or entity selected by the administrator, to institute an exchange program by which outstanding awards may be surrendered in exchange for awards that may have different exercise prices and terms, to prescribe rules and to construe and interpret the 2010 Plan and awards granted thereunder.
Stock Options. The administrator may grant incentive and/or nonstatutory stock options under our 2010 Plan; provided that incentive stock options are only granted to employees. The exercise price of such options
 
144
Table of Contents

must equal at least the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. The term of an option may not exceed ten years. Provided, however, that an incentive stock option held by a participant who owns more than 10% of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock, or of certain of our parent or subsidiary corporations, may not have a term in excess of five years and must have an exercise price of at least 110% of the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The administrator will determine the methods of payment of the exercise price of an option, which may include cash, shares or other property acceptable to the plan administrator. Subject to the provisions of our 2010 Plan, the administrator determines the remaining terms of the options (e.g., vesting). After the termination of service of an employee, director or consultant, the participant may exercise his or her option, to the extent vested as of such date of termination, for the period of time stated in his or her option agreement. Generally, if termination is due to death or disability, the option will remain exercisable for twelve months. In all other cases, the option will generally remain exercisable for three months following the termination of service. However, in no event may an option be exercised later than the expiration of its term.
Stock Appreciation Rights. Stock appreciation rights may be granted under our 2010 Plan. Stock appreciation rights allow the recipient to receive the appreciation in the fair market value of our common stock between the exercise date and the date of grant. Subject to the provisions of our 2010 Plan, the administrator determines the terms of stock appreciation rights, including when such rights vest and become exercisable and whether to settle such awards in cash or with shares of our common stock, or a combination thereof, except that the per share exercise price for the shares to be issued pursuant to the exercise of a stock appreciation right will be no less than 100% of the fair market value per share on the date of grant. The specific terms will be set forth in an award agreement.
Restricted Stock. Restricted stock may be granted under our 2010 Plan. Restricted stock awards are grants of shares of our common stock that are subject to various restrictions, including restrictions on transferability and forfeiture provisions. Shares of restricted stock will vest and the restrictions on such shares will lapse, in accordance with terms and conditions established by the administrator. Such terms may include, among other things, vesting upon the achievement of specific performance goals determined by the administrator and/or continued service to us. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. Recipients of restricted stock awards generally will have voting and dividend rights with respect to such shares upon grant without regard to vesting, unless the administrator provides otherwise. Shares of restricted stock that do not vest for any reason will be forfeited by the recipient and will revert to us. The specific terms will be set forth in an award agreement.
Restricted Stock Units. Restricted stock units may be granted under our 2010 Plan. Each restricted stock unit granted is a bookkeeping entry representing an amount equal to the fair market value of one share of our common stock. The administrator determines the terms and conditions of restricted stock units including the vesting criteria, which may include achievement of specified performance criteria or continued service to us, and the form and timing of payment. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may accelerate the time at which any restrictions will lapse or be removed. The administrator determines in its sole discretion whether an award will be settled in stock, cash or a combination of both. The specific terms will be set forth in an award agreement.
Performance Units/Performance Shares. Performance units and performance shares may be granted under our 2010 Plan. Performance units and performance shares are awards that will result in a payment to a participant only if performance goals established by the administrator are achieved or the awards otherwise vest. The administrator will establish organizational or individual performance goals in its discretion, which, depending on the extent to which they are met, will determine the number and/or the value of performance units and performance shares to be paid out to participants. After the grant of a performance unit or performance share, the administrator, in its sole discretion, may reduce or waive any performance objectives or other vesting provisions for such performance units or performance shares. Performance units shall have an initial dollar value established by the administrator prior to the grant date. Performance shares shall have an initial value equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the grant date. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may pay earned
 
145
Table of Contents

performance units or performance shares in the form of cash, in shares or in some combination thereof. The specific terms will be set forth in an award agreement.
Automatic Director Grants. Our 2010 Plan also provides for the automatic grant of nonstatutory stock options to our non-employee directors. Each non-employee director initially appointed to the board of directors after the completion of this offering will automatically receive an option to purchase 100,000 shares upon such appointment (excluding an employee director who ceases to be an employee but remains a director). This initial award will vest as to 25% of the shares subject to the option on the one year anniversary of the vesting commencement date and  1/48th of the shares subject to the option each month thereafter over the next three years, provided he or she continues to serve as a director through each relevant vesting date. In addition, beginning in fiscal year 2011, non-employee directors will automatically receive a subsequent option to purchase 50,000 shares shortly after each date of our annual meeting of stockholders. These subsequent awards will vest as to 100% of shares subject to the award on the earlier of (1) the one year anniversary of the vesting commencement date or (2) the day prior to the next annual meeting of stockholders; provided he or she continues to serve as a director through the relevant vesting date. All awards granted under the automatic grant provisions will have a term of seven years or such earlier expiration date specified in the applicable award agreement, an exercise price equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and will be freely transferable to the non-employee directors’ venture capital funds or employers (or an affiliate, within the meaning of Section 424(e) or (f) of the Code, of a non-employee director’s employer). The administrator may change the number, type and terms of future automatic awards granted to our non-employee director under the 2010 Plan. Additionally, non-employee directors are eligible to receive discretionary grants.
Transferability of Awards. Unless the administrator provides otherwise, our 2010 Plan generally does not allow for the transfer of awards and only the recipient of an option or stock appreciation right may exercise such an award during his or her lifetime.
Certain Adjustments. In the event of certain changes in our capitalization, to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits available under the 2010 Plan, the administrator will make adjustments to one or more of the number and class of shares that may be delivered under the plan and/or the number, class and price of shares covered by each outstanding award and the numerical share limits contained in the plan. In the event of our proposed liquidation or dissolution, the administrator will notify participants as soon as practicable and all awards will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed transaction.
Merger or Change in Control. Our 2010 Plan provides that in the event of a merger or change in control, as defined under the 2010 Plan, each outstanding award will be treated as the administrator determines, except that if a successor corporation or its parent or subsidiary does not assume or substitute an equivalent award for any outstanding award, then such award will fully vest, all restrictions on such award will lapse, all performance goals or other vesting criteria applicable to such award will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels and such award will become fully exercisable, if applicable, for a specified period prior to the transaction. The award will then terminate upon the expiration of the specified period of time. If the service of an outside director is terminated on or following a change of control, other than pursuant to a voluntary resignation, his or her options, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights, if any, will vest fully and become immediately exercisable, all restrictions on his or her restricted stock will lapse, and all performance goals or other vesting requirements for his or her performance shares and units will be deemed achieved at 100% of target levels, and all other terms and conditions met.
Plan Amendment, Termination. Our board of directors has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate the 2010 Plan provided such action does not impair the existing rights of any participant. Our 2010 Plan will automatically terminate in 2020, unless we terminate it sooner.

2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan
Concurrently with this offering, we are establishing our 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, or the ESPP. Our board of directors has adopted, and we expect our stockholders to approve, the ESPP prior to the completion of this offering. Our executive officers and all of our other employees will be allowed to participate in our ESPP.
A total of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock will be made available for sale under our ESPP. In addition, our ESPP provides for annual increases in the number of shares available for issuance under the ESPP on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the 2011 fiscal year, equal to the least of:
 
 	•	 	
3,000,000 shares;

 
 	•	 	
1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on the first day of such fiscal year; or

 
 	•	 	
such other amount as may be determined by the administrator.

Our board of directors or its committee has full and exclusive authority to interpret the terms of the ESPP and determine eligibility.
All of our employees are eligible to participate if they are customarily employed by us or any participating subsidiary for at least 20 hours per week and more than five months in any calendar year. However, an employee may not be granted rights to purchase stock under our ESPP if such employee:
 
 	•

holds rights to purchase stock under all of our employee stock purchase plans that would accrue at a rate that exceeds $25,000 worth of our stock for each calendar year.

Our ESPP is intended to qualify under Section 423 of the Code, and provides for consecutive, non-overlapping six-month offering periods. The offering periods generally start on the first trading day on or after May 20 and November 20 of each year, except for the first such offering period which will commence on the first trading day on or after the effective date of this offering and will end on November 22, 2010. The administrator may, in its discretion, modify the terms of future offering periods.
Our ESPP permits participants to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, which includes a participant’s regular and recurring straight time gross earnings, payments for overtime and shift premium, exclusive of payments for incentive compensation, bonuses and other similar compensation. A participant may purchase a maximum of 500 shares of common stock during each six-month offering period.
Amounts deducted and accumulated by the participant are used to purchase shares of our common stock at the end of each six-month offering period. The purchase price of the shares will be 85% of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock on the first trading day of the offering period or on the last day of the offering period. Participants may end their participation at any time during an offering period, and will be paid their accrued payroll deductions that have not yet been used to purchase shares of common stock. Participation ends automatically upon termination of employment with us.
A participant may not transfer rights granted under the ESPP other than by will, the laws of descent and distribution or as otherwise provided under the ESPP.
In the event of our merger or change of control, as defined under the ESPP, a successor corporation may assume or substitute each outstanding purchase right. If the successor corporation refuses to assume or substitute for the outstanding purchase rights, the offering period then in progress will be shortened, and a new exercise date will be set. The plan administrator will notify each participant in writing that the exercise date has been
 
147
Table of Contents

changed and that the participant’s option will be exercised automatically on the new exercise date unless the participant has already withdrawn from the offering period.
Our ESPP will automatically terminate in 2020, unless we terminate it sooner. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to amend, suspend or terminate our ESPP, except that, subject to certain exceptions described in the ESPP, no such action may adversely affect any outstanding rights to purchase stock under our ESPP.
401(k) Plan
We maintain a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement plan for all employees who satisfy certain eligibility requirements, including requirements relating to age and length of service. Under our 401(k) plan, employees may elect to defer up to 90% of their eligible compensation subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Code limits. We currently do not match any contributions made by our employees, including executives. We intend for the 401(k) plan to qualify under Section 401(a) and 501(a) of the Code so that contributions by employees to the 401(k) plan, and income earned on those contributions, are not taxable to employees until withdrawn from the 401(k) plan.
Other
In addition to the United States, we currently have employees located in the United Kingdom, Canada, Monaco, Germany and Taiwan. In addition to providing statutorily mandated benefit programs in each country, we contribute to private plans for health, pension and insurance benefits in the countries where those contributions are customarily provided to employees.
Limitation on Liability and Indemnification Matters
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, which will be in effect upon the completion of this offering, contain provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Consequently, our directors will not be personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors, except liability for:
 
 	•	 	
any breach of the director’s duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders;

 
 	•	 	
any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;

 
 	•	 	
unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in Section 174 of the Delaware General Corporation Law; or

 
 	•	 	
any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.

Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws to be in effect upon the completion of this offering provide that we are required to indemnify our directors and officers, in each case to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that we are obligated to advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding, and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer, director, employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in that capacity regardless of whether we would otherwise be permitted to indemnify him or her under the provisions of Delaware law. We have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors, executive officers and other employees as determined by our board of directors. With specified exceptions, these agreements provide for indemnification for related expenses including, among other things, attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these individuals in any action or proceeding. We believe that these certificate of incorporation and bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers. We also maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance.
 
148
Table of Contents

The limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty. They may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers, even though an action, if successful, might benefit us and other stockholders. Further, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against directors and officers as required by these indemnification provisions. At present, there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors, officers or employees for which indemnification is sought, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation that may result in claims for indemnification.

Daimler Agreements
Financing Agreements
In connection with our Series E preferred stock financing in May 2009, we entered into certain agreements with Daimler, Daimler North America Corporation, or DNAC, and Blackstar. Herbert Kohler, a member of our board of directors, is a Vice President of Blackstar and Daimler.
We entered into a side agreement with Blackstar pursuant to which we are obligated to give Blackstar notice of any proposal we receive relating to an acquisition of us for which we determine to engage in discussions with a potential acquiror or otherwise pursue. The notice shall include the material terms and conditions of such proposal and the identity of the proposed acquiror. The agreement further provides that Blackstar may, within a specified time period, submit a competing acquisition proposal. Blackstar’s rights under this agreement are not transferable except to Daimler or a controlled affiliate of Daimler. This agreement will terminate on December 31, 2011 or earlier upon the occurrence of certain other events including an acquisition of us or certain changes in our relationship with Daimler and Blackstar.
Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our board of directors, entered into a letter agreement with Blackstar pursuant to which Mr. Musk has agreed not to transfer any shares of our capital stock beneficially owned by him to any automobile original equipment manufacturer, other than Daimler, without Blackstar’s consent. Mr. Musk has further agreed not to vote any shares of our capital stock beneficially owned by him in favor of a deemed liquidation transaction to which any automobile original equipment manufacturer, other than Daimler, is a party without Blackstar’s consent. This agreement will terminate on December 31, 2011 or earlier upon the occurrence of certain other events including an acquisition of us or certain changes in our relationship with Daimler and Blackstar.
In addition, we have granted certain covenants to Daimler as part of our investors’ rights agreement. These covenants provide that if Mr. Musk is not serving as our Chief Executive Officer at any time until the later of December 31, 2012 or the launch of the Model S, Mr. Musk shall promptly propose a successor Chief Executive Officer and Dr. Kohler, or his successor, must consent to any appointment of such person by our Board of Directors. If Mr. Musk departs as our Chief Executive Officer prior to December 31, 2010, for reasons other than his death or disability, and Dr. Kohler, or his successor, has not consented to the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Daimler has the right to terminate any or all of its strategic collaboration agreements with us. Furthermore, if at any time during the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2012, Mr. Musk is not serving as either our Chief Executive Officer or Chairman of our Board of Directors for reasons other than his death or disability, and Dr. Kohler, or his successor, has not consented to the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer or if during such period Mr. Musk renders services to, or invests in, any other automotive OEM other than us, Daimler has the right to terminate any or all of its strategic collaboration agreements with us.
Strategic Agreements
We have entered into two agreements with Daimler and DNAC. On May 1, 2009, we and Daimler entered into a strategic agreement titled “SMART 451 ED Predevelopment Contract” under which we agreed to develop and supply battery systems to Daimler for use in a “Smart EV Project.” Subsequently, on May 11, 2009, in connection with our Series E Preferred Stock financing transaction in which Blackstar purchased shares of our Series E Preferred Stock as described above, we and DNAC entered into the EIP Agreement. Under the EIP Agreement, we and DNAC agreed to begin the process of negotiating, in good faith, to enter into further agreements regarding areas of strategic cooperation, or the Strategic Agreements. In particular, the parties agreed to negotiate in good faith to enter into up to four additional agreements covering among other areas, strategic cooperation, the joint development of technology, and the supply of electric vehicle components to each other. As of November 30, 2009, we and Daimler (or any Daimler affiliate) have not yet entered into these agreements.
In addition to providing an exclusivity period for negotiation of the Strategic Agreements, the EIP Agreement specified certain terms that the parties would agree to include in those agreements. In particular we
 
153
Table of Contents

agreed that certain of the Strategic Agreements would include exclusivity provisions which would limit us from entering into competitive arrangements with other automotive companies, however we would not be subject to any restrictions with respect to our Tesla Roaster and Model S vehicles. Further, if a third party offers to enter into a competitive transaction with us, we are required to give DNAC notice of such offer. If DNAC declines to enter into such transaction on the same terms as offered by the third party, then we would be free to enter into the competitive transaction with the third party, subject to certain limitations. The EIP Agreement also provides for the allocation of each party’s right to patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights in the event we do enter into any of the Strategic Agreements and places limitations on Daimler’s and our rights to license this intellectual property to competitors.
Other Transactions
In the ordinary course of business, we enter into offer letters and employment agreements with our executive officers. In addition, certain of our directors, officers, and persons affiliated with our significant stockholders, including Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Mr. Gracias, and persons affiliated with Valor Equity Partners and VantagePoint Venture Partners, have purchased or placed a reservation to purchase a Tesla Roadster. These transactions were arms length transactions and are on the same terms as other customers who reserved vehicles.
In connection with an offer letter dated November 10, 2006 to Darryl Siry, our former Vice President of Sales, Marketing and Service, we loaned Mr. Siry $40,000 at an interest rate of five percent (5%) per annum pursuant to an employee loan agreement, dated December 1, 2006. The loan was used to relocate his residence. The loan was forgiven on December 2, 2007, pursuant to the terms of the agreement after Mr. Siry completed employment services to us through December 1, 2007.
We have an informal arrangement with Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, for the use of building space and information technology services in the facilities of SpaceX in Hawthorne, California. In August 2009, we began paying for the use of such facilities on a per square foot basis and for the information technology services. Monthly payments for such facilities and services amount to approximately $11,000 per month. In addition, SpaceX has from time to time in the past paid for facilities and services expenses on our behalf, for which we subsequently reimbursed SpaceX. Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman, is also the Chief Executive Officer and a significant stockholder of SpaceX. Steve Jurvetson and Kimbal Musk, two members of our board of directors, are also members of the board of directors of SpaceX. We reimbursed SpaceX for an aggregate of $90,000 for this use during 2008 and $179,000 for this use during 2009.
From time to time, Elon Musk uses his private airplane for Tesla business travel. Beginning in the second quarter of 2009, we agreed to pay for certain third-party operation expenses incurred in connection with the use of Mr. Musk’s private plane for business travel. These operation expenses include fuel charges, landing fees and other related expenses. Through December 31, 2009, we paid approximately $175,000 for such expenses. Prior to the second quarter of 2009, Mr. Musk paid for such business travel expenses without reimbursement.
Investors’ Rights Agreement
We have entered into an investors’ rights agreement with certain holders of our common stock and preferred stock that provides for certain rights relating to the registration of their shares of common stock, including those issued upon conversion of their preferred stock. See “Description of Capital Stock—Registration Rights” below for additional information. In addition, our investors’ rights agreement contains certain covenants relating to Elon Musk’s employment as our Chief Executive Officer, as described under “Daimler Agreements—Financing Agreements” above.

Offer Letters

The indemnification agreements and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws require us to indemnify our directors and officers to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. See “Executive Compensation—Limitation on Liability and Indemnification Matters.”

PRINCIPAL AND SELLING STOCKHOLDERS
The following table sets forth certain information with respect to the beneficial ownership of our common stock at December 31, 2009, as adjusted to reflect the sale of common stock offered by us in this offering, for:
 
 	•	 	
each person, or group of affiliated persons, who we know beneficially owns more than 5% of our outstanding shares of common stock;

 
 	•	 	
each of our directors;

 
 	•	 	
each of our named executive officers; and

 
 	•	 	
all of our current directors and executive officers as a group; and

 
 	•	 	
all selling stockholders.

We have determined beneficial ownership in accordance with the rules of the SEC. Except as indicated by the footnotes below, we believe, based on the information furnished to us, that the persons and entities named in the table below have sole voting and investment power with respect to all shares of common stock that they beneficially own, subject to applicable community property laws.
Applicable percentage ownership is based on             shares of common stock outstanding at December 31, 2009, after giving effect to the conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into common stock effective immediately prior to the closing of this offering and the issuance of             shares of common stock upon the assumed net exercise of warrants that expire upon the completion of this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $             per share. For purposes of the table below, we have assumed that             shares of common stock will be outstanding upon completion of this offering. In computing the number of shares of common stock beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock subject to options or other convertible securities held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable or exercisable within 60 days of December 31, 2009. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage ownership of any other person. Beneficial ownership representing less than 1% is denoted below with an asterisk (*).
The table below excludes 9,255,035 shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of a warrant granted to the DOE in connection with the closing of our DOE Loan Facility.

DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK
General
The following is a summary of our capital stock and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as they will be in effect upon the closing of this offering. This summary does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, copies of which have been filed as exhibits to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part.
Immediately following the closing of this offering, our authorized capital stock will consist of 2,100,000,000 shares, with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which:
 
 	•	 	
2,000,000,000 shares are designated as common stock; and

 
 	•	 	
100,000,000 shares are designated as preferred stock.

As of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding             shares of common stock, held of record by 260 stockholders, and no shares of preferred stock, assuming the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of our preferred stock into common stock immediately prior to the closing of this offering and the issuance of             shares of common stock upon the assumed net exercise of warrants that expire upon the completion of this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $             per share. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, we also had outstanding options to acquire 34,923,477 shares of common stock.
Common Stock
The holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders and do not have cumulative voting rights. Accordingly, holders of a majority of the shares of common stock entitled to vote in any election of directors may elect all of the directors standing for election. Subject to preferences that may be applicable to any preferred stock outstanding at the time, the holders of outstanding shares of common stock are entitled to receive ratably any dividends declared by our board of directors out of assets legally available. See the section entitled “Dividend Policy.” Upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, holders of our common stock are entitled to share ratably in all assets remaining after payment of liabilities and the liquidation preference of any then outstanding shares of preferred stock. Holders of common stock have no preemptive or conversion rights or other subscription rights. There are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to the common stock. All outstanding shares of common stock are, and all shares of common stock to be outstanding upon completion of this offering will be, fully paid and nonassessable.
Preferred Stock
After the closing of this offering, no shares of preferred stock will be outstanding. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our board of directors will have the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue from time to time up to 100,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may designate the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock, including dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, liquidation preference, sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of any series. The issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of restricting dividends on our common stock, diluting the voting power of our common stock, impairing the liquidation rights of our common stock or delaying deterring or preventing a change in control. Such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock or even the ability to issue preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change in control. We currently have no plans to issue any shares of preferred stock.

Warrants
At December 31, 2009, we had warrants outstanding to purchase 1,549,540 shares of our common stock, assuming the automatic conversion of our preferred stock into common stock, at exercise prices ranging from $1.135 to $2.5124 per share. Upon the completion of this offering, all of these warrants will expire if not exercised. Each warrant contains provisions for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, reorganizations, and reclassifications, consolidations and the like.
In connection with our loan facility from the United States Department of Energy, or DOE Loan Facility, we have issued the DOE a warrant to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our common stock, assuming the automatic conversion of our preferred stock into common stock, at an exercise price of $2.5124 per share. The shares subject to the warrant will vest and become exercisable beginning on December 15, 2018 in quarterly amounts through December 14, 2022 proportionately based on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the prior quarter. If we prepay our DOE Loan Facility in full or in part, the total amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be proportionately reduced. If not exercised, this warrant will expire after December 15, 2023. Upon an event of default either arising from a change of control or any other event of default that is not cured after a certain period, the warrant will vest with respect to all unvested shares then remaining under the warrant. Prior to December 15, 2018, the warrant is transferable by the DOE only to other federal agencies of the United States government. After December 15, 2018, the warrant is transferable to any other person or entity. The warrant contains provisions for the adjustment of the exercise price and the number of shares issuable upon exercise in the event of stock dividends, stock splits, reorganizations, and reclassifications, consolidations and the like.
Registration Rights
Stockholder Registration Rights
Following this offering’s completion, the holders of an aggregate of             shares of our common stock, or their permitted transferees, are entitled to rights with respect to the registration of these shares under the Securities Act. These rights are provided under the terms of an investors’ rights agreement between us and the holders of these shares, and include demand registration rights, short-form registration rights and piggyback registration rights. All fees, costs and expenses of underwritten registrations will be borne by us and all selling expenses, including underwriting discounts and selling commissions, will be borne by the holders of the shares being registered.
The registration rights terminate with respect to the registration rights of an individual holder after the date that is five years following such time when the holder can sell all of the holder’s shares in any three month period under Rule 144 or another similar exemption under the Securities Act, unless such holder holds at least 2% of our voting stock.
Demand Registration Rights. The holders of an aggregate of             shares of our common stock, or their permitted transferees, are entitled to demand registration rights. Under the terms of the investors’ rights agreement, we will be required, at our expense, upon the written request of holders of a majority of these shares, to use our best efforts to register all or a portion of these shares for public resale. We are required to effect only two registrations pursuant to this provision of the investors’ rights agreement. In addition, we are required to effect up to two separate registrations upon the written request of Blackstar Investco LLC, or Blackstar. We are not required to effect a demand registration prior to 6 months after the effective date of this registration statement.
Short-Form Registration Rights. The holders of an aggregate of             shares of our common stock, or their permitted transferees, are also entitled to short-form registration rights. If we are eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3, these holders have the right, upon written request from either the holders of at least 20% of these shares to us, or Blackstar, to have such shares registered by us at our expense if the proposed aggregate

offering price of the shares to be registered by the holders requesting registration, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, is at least $1,000,000, subject to certain exceptions.
Piggyback Registration Rights. The holders of an aggregate of             shares of our common stock, or their permitted transferees, are entitled to piggyback registration rights. If we register any of our securities either for our own account or for the account of other security holders, after the completion of this offering the holders of these shares are entitled to include their shares in the registration at our expense. The underwriters of any underwritten offering have the right to limit the number of shares registered by these holders for marketing reasons, subject to certain limitations.
DOE Registration Rights
In connection our DOE Loan Facility, we have also granted certain registration rights to the DOE related to the shares exercisable upon the warrant issued to the DOE described above. These registration rights will only become effective if the DOE elects to exercise all or a portion of the shares subject to the warrant.
Demand Registration Rights. Under the terms of this agreement, the DOE is entitled to demand two registrations of our common stock. If the DOE initiates a demand registration pursuant to this provision, we will be required to use best efforts to register all or a portion of these shares for public resale. We are not required to effect a demand registration prior to 180 days after the completion of this offering.
Short-Form Registration Rights. The DOE is entitled to short-form registration rights. If we are eligible to file a registration statement on Form S-3, the DOE has the right, upon written request, to have such shares registered by us at our expense if the proposed aggregate offering price of the shares to be registered by the holders requesting registration, net of underwriting discounts and commissions, is at least $1,000,000, subject to certain exceptions.
Piggyback Registration Rights. The DOE is entitled to piggyback registration rights. If we register any of our securities either for our own account or for the account of other security holders, the DOE is entitled to include its shares in the registration. The underwriters of any underwritten offering have the right to limit the number of shares registered by the DOE for marketing reasons, subject to certain limitations.
Anti-Takeover Effects of Delaware Law and Our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws, which will be in effect upon the closing of this offering, contain certain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing another party from acquiring control of us. These provisions and certain provisions of Delaware law, which are summarized below, are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids. These provisions are also designed, in part, to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate first with our board of directors. We believe that the benefits of increased protection of our potential ability to negotiate more favorable terms with an unfriendly or unsolicited acquirer outweigh the disadvantages of discouraging a proposal to acquire us.
Undesignated Preferred Stock. As discussed above, our board of directors has the ability to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us. These and other provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of our company.
Limits on Ability of Stockholders to Act by Written Consent or Call a Special Meeting. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that our stockholders may not act by written consent, which may lengthen the amount of time required to take stockholder actions. As a result, a holder controlling a majority of our capital stock would not be able to amend our bylaws or remove directors without holding a meeting of our stockholders called in accordance with our bylaws.
 
161
Table of Contents

In addition, our amended and restated bylaws provide that special meetings of the stockholders may be called only by the chairperson of the board, the chief executive officer or our board of directors. Stockholders may not call a special meeting, which may delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or for holders controlling a majority of our capital stock to take any action, including the removal of directors.
Requirements for Advance Notification of Stockholder Nominations and Proposals. Our amended and restated bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors, other than nominations made by or at the direction of our board of directors or a committee of our board of directors. These provisions may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed. These provisions may also discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer’s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of our company.
Board Classification. Our board of directors is divided into three classes, one class of which is elected each year by our stockholders. The directors in each class will serve for a three-year term. For more information on the classified board, see “Management—Board of Directors.” A third party may be discouraged from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us as it is it more difficult and time-consuming for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors on a classified board.
No Cumulative Voting. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws do not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors. Cumulative voting allows a stockholder to vote a portion or all of its shares for one or more candidates for seats on the board of directors. Without cumulative voting, a minority stockholder may not be able to gain as many seats on our board of directors as the stockholder would be able to gain if cumulative voting were permitted. The absence of cumulative voting makes it more difficult for a minority stockholder to gain a seat on our board of directors to influence our board’s decision regarding a takeover.
Amendment of Charter Provisions. The amendment of the above provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires approval by holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.
Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute. We are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law regulating corporate takeovers. In general, Section 203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging, under certain circumstances, in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date the person became an interested stockholder unless:
 
 	•	 	
prior to the date of the transaction, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;

 
 	•	 	
upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of the voting stock of the corporation outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, calculated as provided under Section 203; or

 
 	•	 	
at or subsequent to the date of the transaction, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, and not by written consent, by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock which is not owned by the interested stockholder.

Generally, a business combination includes a merger, asset or stock sale, or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. An interested stockholder is a person who, together with affiliates and associates, owns or, within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status, did own 15% or more of a corporation’s outstanding voting stock. We expect the existence of this provision to have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions our board of directors does not approve in advance. We also
 
162
Table of Contents

anticipate that Section 203 may also discourage attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares of common stock held by stockholders.
The provisions of Delaware law and the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended upon the closing of this offering, could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and, as a consequence, they might also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts. These provisions might also have the effect of preventing changes in our management. It is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests.
Transfer Agent and Registrar
Upon the closing of this offering, the transfer agent and registrar for our common stock will be ComputerShare Trust Company, N.A. The transfer agent’s address is 250 Royall Street, Canton, Massachusetts 02021, and its telephone number is (800) 662-7232.
Listing
We have applied to have our common stock listed on the             under the symbol “            .”

SHARES ELIGIBLE FOR FUTURE SALE
Prior to this offering, there has been no public market for shares of our common stock. Future sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, in the public market after this offering, or the possibility of these sales occurring, could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock from time to time or impair our ability to raise equity capital in the future.
Upon the closing of this offering, a total of              shares of common stock will be outstanding, assuming the automatic conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into shares of common stock upon the completion of this offering and the issuance of              shares of common stock upon the assumed net exercise of warrants that would otherwise expire upon the completion of this offering at an assumed initial public offering price of $             per share. Of these shares, all              shares of common stock sold in this offering by us and the selling stockholders, plus any shares sold upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, will be freely tradable in the public market without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, unless these shares are held by “affiliates,” as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act.
The remaining shares of common stock will be “restricted securities,” as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. These restricted securities are eligible for public sale only if they are registered under the Securities Act or if they qualify for an exemption from registration under Rules 144 or 701 under the Securities Act, which are summarized below.
Subject to the lock-up agreements described below and the provisions of Rules 144 and 701 under the Securities Act, these restricted securities will be available for sale in the public market as follows:

In addition, of the 34,923,477 shares of our common stock that were subject to stock options outstanding as of December 31, 2009, options to purchase 6,743,578 shares of common stock were vested as of December 31, 2009 and will be eligible for sale 180 days following the effective date of this offering, subject to extension as described in the section entitled “Underwriters.”
Rule 144
In general, under Rule 144 as currently in effect, once we have been subject to public company reporting requirements for at least 90 days, a person who is not deemed to have been one of our affiliates for purposes of the Securities Act at any time during 90 days preceding a sale and who has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least six months, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, is entitled to sell such shares without complying with the manner of sale, volume limitation or notice provisions of Rule 144, subject to compliance with the public information requirements of Rule 144. If such a person has beneficially owned the shares proposed to be sold for at least one year, including the holding period of any prior owner other than our affiliates, then such person is entitled to sell such shares without complying with any of the requirements of Rule 144.
In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are entitled to sell upon expiration of the lock-up agreements described above, within any three-month period beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:
 
 	•	 	
1% of the number of shares of common stock then outstanding, which will equal approximately              shares immediately after this offering; or

 
 	•	 	
the average weekly trading volume of the common stock during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of a notice on Form 144 with respect to such sale.

 
164
Table of Contents

Sales under Rule 144 by our affiliates or persons selling shares on behalf of our affiliates are also subject to certain manner of sale provisions and notice requirements and to the availability of current public information about us.
Rule 701
Rule 701 generally allows a stockholder who purchased shares of our common stock pursuant to a written compensatory plan or contract and who is not deemed to have been an affiliate of our company during the immediately preceding 90 days to sell these shares in reliance upon Rule 144, but without being required to comply with the public information, holding period, volume limitation, or notice provisions of Rule 144. Rule 701 also permits affiliates of our company to sell their Rule 701 shares under Rule 144 without complying with the holding period requirements of Rule 144. All holders of Rule 701 shares, however, are required to wait until 90 days after the date of this prospectus before selling such shares pursuant to Rule 701.
As of December 31, 2009, 3,452,254 shares of our outstanding common stock had been issued in reliance on Rule 701 as a result of exercises of stock options. These shares will be eligible for resale in reliance on this rule upon expiration of the lockup agreements described above.
Lock-Up Agreements
We, the selling stockholders, all of our directors and officers and the other holders of shares of common stock and holders of securities exercisable for or convertible into our common stock outstanding immediately prior to this offering have agreed that, without the prior written consent of each of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. on behalf of the underwriters, we and they will not, during the period ending 180 days after the date of this prospectus:
 
 	•	 	
offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of any shares of our common stock, options or warrants to purchase shares of our common stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive shares of our common stock; or

 
 	•	 	
engage in any other transaction which is designed to or which reasonably could be expected to lead to or result in a sale or disposition of shares of our common stock;

whether any transaction described above is to be settled by delivery of shares of our common stock or such other securities, in cash or otherwise. This agreement is subject to certain exceptions, and is also subject to extension for up to an additional 34 days, as set forth in the section entitled “Underwriters.”
Registration Rights
Upon completion of this offering, the holders of             shares of common stock or their transferees will be entitled to various rights with respect to the registration of these shares under the Securities Act. In addition, the DOE will be entitled to various rights with respect to the registration of the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant we have issued the DOE in connection with the DOE Loan Facility. Registration of these shares under the Securities Act would result in these shares becoming fully tradable without restriction under the Securities Act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration, except for shares purchased by affiliates. See “Description of Capital Stock–Registration Rights” for additional information. Shares covered by a registration statement will be eligible for sales in the public market upon the expiration or release from the terms of the lock up agreement.

MATERIAL UNITED STATES TAX CONSIDERATIONS
FOR NON-UNITED STATES HOLDERS
The following is a summary of the material United States federal income tax and estate tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of our common stock to non-United States holders, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all the potential tax considerations relating thereto. This summary is based upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, administrative rulings and judicial decisions, all as of the date hereof. These authorities may be changed, possibly retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax or estate tax consequences different from those set forth below. We have not sought any ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, or the IRS, with respect to the statements made and the conclusions reached in the following summary, and there can be no assurance that the IRS will agree with such statements and conclusions.
This summary also does not address the tax considerations arising under the laws of any United States state or local or any non-United States jurisdiction or under United States federal gift and estate tax laws, except to the limited extent below. In addition, this discussion does not address tax considerations applicable to an investor’s particular circumstances or to investors that may be subject to special tax rules, including, without limitation:
 
 	•	 	
banks, insurance companies or other financial institutions;

 
 	•	 	
persons subject to the alternative minimum tax;

 
 	•	 	
tax-exempt organizations;

 
 	•	 	
dealers in securities or currencies;

 
 	•	 	
traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities holdings;

 
 	•	 	
persons that own, or are deemed to own, more than five percent of our capital stock (except to the extent specifically set forth below);

 
 	•	 	
certain former citizens or long-term residents of the United States;

 
 	•	 	
persons who hold our common stock as a position in a hedging transaction, “straddle,” “conversion transaction” or other risk reduction transaction;

 
 	•	 	
persons who do not hold our common stock as a capital asset within the meaning of Section 1221 of the Code (generally, for investment purposes); or

 
 	•	 	
persons deemed to sell our common stock under the constructive sale provisions of the Code.

In addition, if a partnership or entity classified as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes holds our common stock, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend on the status of the partner and upon the activities of the partnership. Accordingly, partnerships that hold our common stock, and partners in such partnerships, should consult their tax advisors.
You are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of the United States federal income tax laws to your particular situation, as well as any tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of our common stock arising under the United States federal estate or gift tax rules or under the laws of any United States state or local or any non-United States or other taxing jurisdiction or under any applicable tax treaty.
Non-United States Holder Defined
For purposes of this discussion, you are a non-United States holder if you are any holder other than:
 
 	•	 	
an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

 
166
Table of Contents

 	•	 	
a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States, any State thereof or the District of Columbia;

 
 	•	 	
an estate whose income is subject to United States federal income tax regardless of its source; or

 
 	•	 	
a trust (x) whose administration is subject to the primary supervision of a United States court and which has one or more United States persons who have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (y) which has made an election to be treated as a United States person.

Distributions
If we make distributions on our common stock, those payments will constitute dividends for United States tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined under United States federal income tax principles. To the extent those distributions exceed both our current and our accumulated earnings and profits, they will constitute a return of capital and will first reduce your basis in our common stock, but not below zero, and then will be treated as gain from the sale of stock.
Any dividend paid to you generally will be subject to United States withholding tax either at a rate of 30% of the gross amount of the dividend or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty. In order to receive a reduced treaty rate, you must provide us with an IRS Form W-8BEN or other appropriate version of IRS Form W-8 certifying qualification for the reduced rate.
Dividends received by you that are effectively connected with your conduct of a United States trade or business generally are exempt from such withholding tax. In order to obtain this exemption, you must provide us with an IRS Form W-8ECI or other applicable IRS Form W-8 properly certifying such exemption. Such effectively connected dividends, although not subject to withholding tax, are taxed at the same graduated rates applicable to United States persons, net of certain deductions and credits, subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise. In addition, if you are a corporate non-United States holder, dividends you receive that are effectively connected with your conduct of a United States trade or business may also be subject to a branch profits tax at a rate of 30% or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.
If you are eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax pursuant to a tax treaty, you may be able to obtain a refund of any excess amounts currently withheld if you file an appropriate claim for refund with the IRS.
Gain on Sale or Other Disposition of Common Stock
You generally will not be required to pay United States federal income tax on any gain realized upon the sale or other disposition of our common stock unless:
 
 	•	 	
the gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a United States trade or business (and, if an income tax treaty applies, the gain is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by you in the United States), in which case you will be required to pay tax on the net gain derived from the sale under regular graduated United States federal income tax rates, and for a non-United States holder that is a corporation, such non-United States holder may be subject to the branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty;

 
 	•	 	
you are an individual who is present in the United States for a period or periods aggregating 183 days or more during the calendar year in which the sale or disposition occurs and certain other conditions are met, in which case you will be required to pay a flat 30% tax on the gain derived from the sale, which tax may be offset by United States source capital losses (even though you are not considered a resident of the United States) (subject to applicable income tax or other treaties); or

 
 	•	 	
our common stock constitutes a United States real property interest by reason of our status as a “United States real property holding corporation” for United States federal income tax purposes, a USRPHC, at any time within the shorter of the five-year period preceding the disposition or your holding period for

 
167
Table of Contents

 	
our common stock. We believe that we are not currently and will not become a USRPHC. However, because the determination of whether we are a USRPHC depends on the fair market value of our United States real property relative to the fair market value of our other business assets, there can be no assurance that we will not become a USRPHC in the future. Even if we become a USRPHC, however, as long as our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market, such common stock will be treated as United States real property interests only if you actually or constructively hold more than five percent of such regularly traded common stock at any time during the applicable period that is specified in the Code.
United States Federal Estate Tax
Our common stock held (or treated as held) by an individual non-United States holder at the time of death will be included in such holder’s gross estate for United States federal estate tax purposes, unless an applicable estate tax treaty provides otherwise, and therefore may be subject to United States federal estate tax.
Backup Withholding and Information Reporting
Generally, we must report annually to the IRS the amount of dividends paid to you, your name and address, and the amount of tax withheld, if any. A similar report will be sent to you. Pursuant to applicable income tax treaties or other agreements, the IRS may make these reports available to tax authorities in your country of residence.
Payments of dividends or of proceeds on the disposition of stock made to you may be subject to additional information reporting and backup withholding at a current rate of 28% unless you establish an exemption, for example by properly certifying your non-United States status on a Form W-8BEN or another appropriate version of IRS Form W-8. Notwithstanding the foregoing, backup withholding and information reporting may apply if either we or our paying agent has actual knowledge, or reason to know, that you are a United States person.
Backup withholding is not an additional tax; rather, the United States income tax liability of persons subject to backup withholding will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld. If withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund or credit may generally be obtained from the IRS, provided that the required information is furnished to the IRS in a timely manner.
The preceding discussion of United States federal tax considerations is for general information only. It is not tax advice. Each prospective investor should consult its own tax advisor regarding the particular United States federal, state and local and non-United States tax consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of our common stock, including the consequences of any proposed change in applicable laws.

Subject to certain conditions, each underwriter has severally agreed to purchase the number of shares indicated in the following table. Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated, J.P.

The underwriters are committed to take and pay for all of the shares being offered, if any are taken, other than the shares covered by the option described below unless and until this option is exercised.
If the underwriters sell more shares than the total number set forth in the table above, the underwriters have an option to buy up to an additional              shares from us and the selling stockholders to cover such sales. They may exercise that option for 30 days. If any shares are purchased pursuant to this option, the underwriters will severally purchase shares in approximately the same proportion as set forth in the table above.
The following tables show the per share and total underwriting discounts and commissions to be paid to the underwriters by us and the selling stockholders. Such amounts are shown assuming both no exercise and full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase              additional shares.

Shares sold by the underwriters to the public will initially be offered at the initial public offering price set forth on the cover of this prospectus. Any shares sold by the underwriters to securities dealers may be sold at a discount of up to $             per share from the initial public offering price. If all the shares are not sold at the initial public offering price, the representatives may change the offering price and the other selling terms.
We, our officers and directors, and holders of substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock including the selling stockholders, have agreed with the underwriters, subject to certain exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell, pledge, grant any option to purchase, make any short sale or otherwise dispose of any shares of common stock, options or warrants to purchase shares of common stock or securities convertible into, exchangeable for or that represent the right to receive shares of common stock, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, during the period from the date of this prospectus continuing through the date 180 days after the date of this prospectus, except with the prior written consent of each of Goldman, Sachs & Co., Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. This agreement does not apply to any existing equity incentive plans, securities issued upon the exercise of options or upon the exercise, conversion or exchange of exercisable,
 
169
Table of Contents

convertible or exchangeable securities outstanding as of the date hereof, issuances of securities in connection with mergers or acquisitions we may make in an aggregate amount not to exceed 5% of our fully diluted outstanding stock as of the date hereof and other customary exceptions.
The 180-day restricted period described in the preceding paragraph will be automatically extended if: (1) during the last 17 days of the 180-day restricted period we issue an earnings release or announces material news or a material event; or (2) prior to the expiration of the 180-day restricted period, we announce that we will release earnings results during the 15-day period beginning on the last day of the 180-day period, in which case the restrictions described in the preceding paragraph will continue to apply until the expiration of the 18-day period beginning on the issuance of the earnings release or the announcement of the material news or material event.
Prior to the offering, there has been no public market for our common stock. The initial public offering price has been negotiated among us and the representatives. Among the factors to be considered in determining the initial public offering price of the shares, in addition to prevailing market conditions, will be our historical performance, estimates of the business potential and earnings prospects of us, an assessment of our management and the consideration of the above factors in relation to market valuation of companies in related businesses.
We intend to file an application to list our common stock on the              under the symbol “            .”
At our request, the underwriters have reserved for sale at the initial public offering price up to             shares of common stock offered for sale to business associates, employees and friends and family members of our employees and Tesla customers who have received delivery of a Tesla Roadster from Tesla. The number of shares of common stock available for sale to the general public will be reduced to the extent that such persons purchase such reserved shares. Any reserved shares not so purchased will be offered by the underwriters to the general public on the same basis as the other shares offered hereby. Other than the underwriting discount described on the front cover of this prospectus, the underwriters will not be entitled to any commission with respect to shares of common stock sold pursuant to the directed share program.
In connection with the offering, the underwriters may purchase and sell shares of common stock in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the underwriters of a greater number of shares than they are required to purchase in the offering. “Covered” short sales are sales made in an amount not greater than the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from us and the selling stockholders in the offering. The underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their option to purchase additional shares or purchasing shares in the open market. In determining the source of shares to close out the covered short position, the underwriters will consider, among other things, the price of shares available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase additional shares pursuant to the option granted to them. “Naked” short sales are any sales in excess of such option. The underwriters must close out any naked short position by purchasing shares in the open market. A naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there may be downward pressure on the price of the common stock in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of various bids for or purchases of common stock made by the underwriters in the open market prior to the completion of the offering.
The underwriters may also impose a penalty bid. This occurs when a particular underwriter repays to the underwriters a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the representative has repurchased shares sold by or for the account of such underwriter in stabilizing or short covering transactions.
Purchases to cover a short position and stabilizing transactions, as well as other purchases by the underwriters for their own accounts, may have the effect of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of our stock, and together with the imposition of the penalty bid, may stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, the price of our common stock may be higher than the price that

otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued at any time. These transactions may be effected on the , in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.
In relation to each Member State of the European Economic Area which has implemented the Prospectus Directive, each of which is referred to as a Relevant Member State, each underwriter has represented and agreed that with effect from and including the date on which the Prospectus Directive is implemented in that Relevant Member State, referred to as the Relevant Implementation Date, it has not made and will not make an offer of shares to the public in that Relevant Member State prior to the publication of a prospectus in relation to the shares which has been approved by the competent authority in that Relevant Member State or, where appropriate, approved in another Relevant Member State and notified to the competent authority in that Relevant Member State, all in accordance with the Prospectus Directive, except that it may, with effect from and including the Relevant Implementation Date, make an offer of shares to the public in that Relevant Member State at any time:

 	•	 	
in any other circumstances which do not require the publication by the Issuer of a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.

Each underwriter has represented and agreed that:
 
 	•	 	
it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the shares in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the Issuer; and

 
 	•	 	
it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything done by it in relation to the shares in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

The shares may not be offered or sold by means of any document other than (1) in circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), or (2) to “professional investors” within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap.571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder, or (3) in other circumstances which do not result in the document being a “prospectus” within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap.32, Laws of Hong Kong), and no advertisement, invitation or document relating to the shares may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere), which is directed at, or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by, the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to shares which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to “professional investors” within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571, Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
To the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Tesla Motors, Inc.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of operations, of convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ deficit and of cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Tesla Motors, Inc. and its subsidiaries at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

Tesla Motors, Inc.
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
1. Overview of the Company
Tesla Motors, Inc. (“Tesla”, “we,” “us” or “our”) was incorporated in the state of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We are engaged in the design, manufacturing and sales of high-performance electric vehicles.
Since inception, we have incurred significant losses and have used approximately $173.8 million of cash in operations through September 30, 2009 (unaudited). As of September 30, 2009, we had approximately $106.5 million (unaudited) in cash and cash equivalents. We are currently selling the Tesla Roadster automobile and are developing the Model S sedan, which we believe will ultimately lead to profitable operations and positive cash flows. To the extent we do not meet our planned sales volumes or future product releases or our existing cash and cash equivalents balances are insufficient to fund our future activities, we will need to raise additional funds. We cannot be certain that additional financing, if and when needed, will be available at terms satisfactory to us, or at all. These consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
On January 20, 2010, we entered into a loan agreement with the United States Federal Financing Bank and United States Department of Energy (“DOE”), pursuant to the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program, authorizing the commitment from the DOE to arrange loans for up to $465.0 million.
The information within these consolidated financial statements that is dated subsequent to December 31, 2008 has not been audited, except for Note 16, Subsequent Events.
2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and its wholly owned subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom, Taiwan, Canada and Germany. All significant inter-company transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Unaudited Interim Financial Statements
The accompanying interim consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2009, the interim consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2009 and the interim consolidated statements of convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ deficit for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 are unaudited. The unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the same basis as the annual consolidated financial statements and, in the opinion of management, reflect all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly our financial position as of September 30, 2009 and our results of operations and cash flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2009. The financial data and the other financial information disclosed in these notes to the consolidated financial statements related to the nine month periods are unaudited. The results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ended December 31, 2009 or for any other future year or interim period.

Unaudited Pro Forma Stockholders’ Equity
The pro forma stockholders’ equity presents our stockholders’ equity as though all of the convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into shares of common stock on a 1 for 1 basis, except for the Series C convertible preferred stock which is convertible on a 1 for 1.05 basis (see Note 6), upon completion of a qualifying initial public offering. In addition, the pro forma stockholders’ equity assumes that the Company’s convertible preferred stock warrants will be exercised immediately prior to a qualifying initial public offering and will no longer require periodic revaluation.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
The carrying values of our cash and cash equivalents, and deposits approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair value. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist only of cash equivalents. Our liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of the convertible preferred stock warrant liability.
All of our cash equivalents, which are comprised primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices, market prices for similar securities, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. We do not have any Level II instruments, or instruments valued based on other observable inputs. Our convertible preferred stock warrant liability is classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy.
As of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value was as follows (in thousands):
 
 	 	December 31, 2008	 	September 30, 2009
 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	 	(Unaudited)

Revenue Recognition
We recognize revenues from sales of the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle (“ZEV”) credits. We recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.
Automotive Sales
Automotive sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sales of the Tesla Roadster, vehicle service, and vehicle options, accessories and destination charges. Sales or other amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. While we have recently arranged for financing options on our vehicles in the United States through a third-party lender, we do not provide direct financing for the purchase of the Tesla Roadster to our customers, unlike most of our competitors.
In regards to the sale of Tesla Roadsters, revenue is generally recognized upon delivery of the vehicle. Concurrent with a purchase order for a Roadster, customers must remit a refundable reservation payment (see Note 4). Prior to scheduled delivery, the customer selects from a list of separately priced options. At this time, the previously paid reservation payment is credited against the final purchase price of the vehicle and the customer is required to remit the remaining balance due. These amounts are recorded as deferred revenue until the time the vehicle is delivered. In a limited number of circumstances, we may deliver a vehicle to a customer without all of the options ordered by the customer if the options do not limit the functionality of the vehicle. This may happen, for example, in an instance where the customer orders an additional hard top which is not ready at the time the vehicle is delivered. In such cases, we will continue to defer the related revenue based on the undelivered item’s fair value, as evidenced by the contractual price of the option in stand-alone transactions.
We began delivery of the Tesla Roadster in 2008. During 2008, many of the vehicles delivered were due powertrain upgrades. Although these vehicles performed to a level adequate for most driving conditions, we had promised our customers an upgrade of the powertrain. As a result, we deferred all revenue recognition of these Tesla Roadsters that we had delivered in 2008 until they were retrofitted with the new powertrain.
While sales of vehicle options and accessories may take place separately from a vehicle sale, they are often part of one vehicle sales agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements. We are able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles, vehicle accessories and options separately, outside of any multiple element arrangements. As each of these items has stand alone value to the customer, revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to the customer.
We record revenue for destination charges billed to our customers. Revenue from destination charges totaled approximately $0.1 million and $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009. The related costs are recorded in cost of sales.
Zero Emission Vehicle Credit Sales
California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. These laws provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn credits, referred to as ZEV credits, and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(continued)
 
As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we have earned ZEV credits on vehicles sold in such states, and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future. Since our only commercial vehicle is electric, we do not receive any benefit from the generation of ZEV credits, and accordingly look to sell them to other vehicle manufacturers. In order to facilitate the sale of these credits, we enter into contractual agreements with third parties requiring them to purchase our ZEV credits at pre-determined prices. We recognize revenue on the sale of these credits at the time legal title to the credits is transferred to the purchasing party by the governmental agency issuing the credits.
Powertrain Development Compensation
In May 2009, we entered into an agreement with Daimler AG (“Daimler”) related to the development of a battery pack and charger for Daimler’s Smart fortwo electric drive. We began development efforts in the year ended December 31, 2008 and began receiving payments to compensate us for the cost of our development activities prior to entering into the formal agreement in May 2009. We received aggregate payments in the amount of $10.2 million during 2008 for our services; however, we deferred recognition for these payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time. Upon entering into the final agreement in May 2009, we had received and deferred an aggregate of $14.5 million under the agreement. Under the terms of the final agreement, Daimler was to pay us an additional $8.7 million subject to successful completion and acceptance of certain development milestones.
We are recognizing the $14.5 million paid in advance of the execution of the final agreement as deferred development compensation on a straight-line basis. This amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement, beginning in May 2009 and continuing through November 2009. Payments received upon the achievement of development milestones subsequent to the execution of the final agreement in May 2009 are recognized, as an offset to our research and development expenses, upon achievement and acceptance of the respective milestones. Amounts received under this agreement are being recognized as an offset to research and development expenses, as we are performing development activities on behalf of Daimler and we are being compensated for the cost of these activities.
As of September 30, 2009, we had collected approximately $21.3 million under the development agreement, of which $17.1 million was recognized during the nine months then ended, and $4.2 million remained in deferred development compensation. As of December 31, 2009, all development work related to the development agreement had been completed, and we expect that the full $23.2 million under the development agreement will be recognized in the quarter ended as of December 31, 2009.
Freestanding Preferred Stock Warrants
We account for freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible preferred stock as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value upon issuance. The convertible preferred stock warrants are recorded as liabilities because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock are contingently redeemable which therefore, may obligate us to transfer assets at some point in the future (see Note 6). The warrants are subject to remeasurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair value is recognized as a component of other income (expense), net, on the consolidated statements of operations. We will continue to adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of the exercise or expiration of the warrants, the completion of a deemed liquidation event, conversion of convertible preferred stock into common stock, or until the convertible preferred stock can no longer trigger a deemed liquidation event. At that time, the convertible preferred stock warrant liability will be reclassified to convertible preferred stock or additional paid-in capital, as applicable.

Cash and Cash Equivalents
All highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. We currently deposit excess cash primarily in money market funds.
Restricted Cash and Deposits
We maintain certain cash amounts restricted as to withdrawal or use. We maintained a balance of approximately $0.3 million, $1.2 million, and $3.6 million as of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, respectively. The restricted cash represents security deposits related to lease agreements, equipment financing, as well as security held by a vendor as part of the vendor’s standard credit policies.
Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts
Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to the performance of powertrain development services as of December 31, 2007, from the performance of powertrain development services and sales of ZEV credits as of December 31, 2008, and from sales of ZEV credits and vehicle sales as of September 30, 2009. In circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we provide an allowance against amounts receivable to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected. As of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, we have determined that it does not require an allowance for doubtful accounts.
Concentration of Risk
Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents and accounts receivable. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds with high credit quality financial institutions in the United States. At times, these deposits and securities may be in excess of insured limits. To date, we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash and cash equivalents. In 2008, our accounts receivable were derived primarily from the performance of powertrain development services and the sale of ZEV credits. In the nine months ended September 30, 2009, our accounts receivable were derived from vehicle sales and the sale of ZEV credits. The accounts receivable balances related to powertrain development services are derived from activities performed for one customer and represented 48% and 0% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, respectively. The accounts receivable balances related to the ZEV credits are derived from sales primarily to one customer who represented 51% of accounts receivable as of December 31, 2008 and another customer who represented 61% of accounts receivable as of September 30, 2009. Additionally, we had a related party accounts receivable which represented 19% of our accounts receivable as of September 30, 2009 (see Note 14). We perform credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and, generally, require no collateral.
A number of components that meet our manufacturing requirements are available only from single source suppliers. For example, Lotus is the only manufacturer for certain components, such as the chassis of our Tesla Roadster. In other instances, although there may be multiple suppliers available, many of the components used in our vehicles must be custom made for us. If these single source suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive prices, we could suffer manufacturing delays, a possible loss of revenues, or incur higher cost of sales, any of which could adversely affect our operating results.

Inventories and Inventory Valuation
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs based on reviews for excess and obsolescence determined primarily by future demand forecasts. We also adjust the carrying value of our inventories when we believe that the net realizable value is less than the carrying value. These write-downs are measured as the difference between the cost of the inventory, including estimated costs to complete, and estimated selling prices. The provisions recorded prior to commencement of sales of the Roadster automobile were recorded as a charge to research and development expenses. Upon the commercial introduction of the Tesla Roadster, charges were recorded as a component of cost of sales. Once inventory is written down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis.
Adverse Purchase Commitments
To the extent future inventory purchases under non-cancellable purchase orders are for excess or obsolete parts or the related inventory is deemed to be in excess of its net realizable value, we record a provision for adverse purchase commitments. The charges recorded prior to commencement of sales of the Roadster automobile in the fourth quarter of 2008 were recorded as research and development expenses. Upon commencement of sales, charges were recorded as a component of cost of sales. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded charges of $1.5 million to research and development expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded charges of $1.0 million to research and development expenses and $0.4 million to cost of sales. During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we recorded charges of $0.8 million to cost of sales.
Property and Equipment
Property and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:
 
Computer equipment and software

  	3 years
Office furniture and equipment

  	3 to 7 years
Tooling

  	5 years
Leasehold improvements

  	5 years
Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred, while major improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably to expense over the identified useful life.
Long-lived Assets
We evaluate our long-lived assets for indicators of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment exists if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. Should impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset over the asset’s estimated fair value. As of September 30, 2009, we have not recorded any impairment losses on our long-lived assets.

Research and Development Costs
Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits of those employees engaged in research, design and development activities, costs related to design tools, license expenses related to intellectual property, supplies and services, depreciation and other occupancy costs.
Income Taxes
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.
Stock-based Compensation
Prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for employee stock-based compensation under an intrinsic value method which required compensation expense for an option to be based on the difference, if any, on the date of the grant, between the fair value of a company’s common stock and the exercise price of the option. Accordingly, no compensation expense was recognized if the exercise price of the option is equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock. Employee stock-based compensation determined under the intrinsic value method was recognized using the multiple option method over the option vesting period.
Effective January 1, 2006, we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock options granted to employees which requires the recognition of compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments, including stock options. The fair value method requires companies to estimate the fair value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model. We adopted the fair value method using the prospective method which requires nonpublic entities that used the minimum value method for either pro forma or financial statement recognition purposes to apply the fair value method to option grants issued on and after the date of adoption. For options that have not yet vested but were granted prior to the adoption of the fair value method, we continue to recognize compensation expense under the intrinsic value method. In addition, we continue to amortize any stock-based compensation from options granted prior to January 1, 2006 utilizing an accelerated amortization schedule, while amortizing the stock-based compensation from options granted or modified after January 1, 2006 on a straight-line basis over the service period.
We have elected to use the “with and without” approach in determining the order in which tax attributes are utilized. As a result, we will only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect effects of stock-based awards on other tax attributes, such as the research tax credit, through our statement of operations.
We account for equity instruments issued to non-employees based on the fair value of the awards. The fair value of the awards granted to non-employees is re-measured as the awards vest and the resulting change in fair value, if any, is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations during the period the related services are rendered.

Foreign Currency Translation
For each of our foreign operations, the functional currency is the U.S. Dollar. For these foreign operations, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non U.S. currencies are re-measured to U.S. Dollars using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. currencies are maintained at historical U.S. Dollar exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are re-measured at average U.S. Dollar monthly rates.
Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations and have not been significant for any periods presented.
Comprehensive Loss
Comprehensive loss includes all changes in equity (net assets) during a period from non-owner sources. Through September 30, 2009, there are no components of comprehensive loss which are not included in net loss; therefore, a separate statement of comprehensive loss has not been presented.
We do not have any foreign currency translation adjustments as a component of other comprehensive loss through September 30, 2009, as the functional currency of all our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. Dollar.
Warranties
We provide a warranty on all vehicle sales, and we accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle is delivered to a customer. Warranty reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of historical data. We review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations. The portion of the warranty provision which is expected to be incurred within 12 months from the balance sheet date is classified as current, while the remaining amount is classified as long-term liabilities.
We began recording warranty reserves with the commencement of Tesla Roadster sales in 2008. Initially, Tesla Roadsters were sold with a warranty of four years or 50,000 miles. More recently, Tesla Roadsters have been sold with a warranty of three years or 36,000 miles. Accrued warranty activities summarized for 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 are as follows (in thousands):

Net Loss per Share of Common Stock
Our basic net loss per share of common stock is calculated by dividing the net loss by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. The weighted-average number of shares of common stock used to calculate our basic net loss per share of common stock excludes those shares subject to repurchase related to stock options that were exercised prior to vesting as these shares are not deemed to be issued for accounting purposes until they vest. The diluted net loss per share of common stock is computed by dividing the net loss using the weighted-average number of common shares, excluding common stock subject to repurchase, and, if dilutive, potential common shares outstanding during the period. Potential common shares consist of common stock subject to repurchase and stock options to purchase common stock and warrants to purchase convertible preferred stock (using the treasury stock method) and the conversion of our convertible preferred stock and convertible notes payable (using the if-converted method).
The following table presents the potential common shares outstanding that were excluded from the computation of diluted net loss per share of common stock for the periods presented because including them would have been antidilutive:

Pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock has been computed to give effect to the assumed conversion of the convertible preferred stock into common stock. Also, the numerator in the pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share calculation has been adjusted to remove gains and losses resulting from re-measurements of the outstanding convertible preferred stock warrant liability as it is assumed that these warrants will be exercised immediately prior to a qualifying initial public offering and will no longer require periodic revaluation.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) which identifies the ASC as the authoritative source of generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) in the United States. Rules and interpretive releases of the SEC under federal securities laws are also sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. We adopted the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance for the interim reporting period ended September 30, 2009. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In September 2006, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB delayed the effective date of the standard until the first quarter of 2009 for all non-financial assets and non-financial liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. The standard does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. In April 2009, the FASB issued further guidance for estimating fair value when the level of market activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased, which is effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In March 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard related to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities. This standard is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring transparency about the location and amounts of derivative instruments in an entity’s financial statements; clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments and related hedged items; and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect its financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In May 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which requires the recognition of both the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments with cash settlement features. Under the standard, the debt component is required to be recognized at the fair value of a similar instrument that does not have an associated equity component. The equity component is recognized as the difference between the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible debt instrument and the fair value of the straight debt liability. The separation of the equity component creates a debt discount which is required to be accreted over the expected life of the debt. Retrospective application to all periods presented is required. This standard is effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2009. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In June 2008, the FASB issued a new accounting standard for determining whether instruments granted in share-based payment transactions are considered participating securities for the purposes of calculating earnings per share. The standard clarified that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common stockholders, and therefore, are considered participating securities. The two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share would have to be applied. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2008. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In May 2009, the FASB issued a new accounting standard which establishes the general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued. The standard, which includes a new requirement to disclose the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events, is effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of the accounting standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
In October 2009, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires companies to allocate revenue in multiple-element arrangements based on an element’s estimated selling price if vendor-specific or other third-party evidence of value is not available. The guidance is effective beginning January 1, 2011 with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating both the timing and the impact of the standard on our consolidated financial statements.

4. Refundable Reservation Payments
During 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we received refundable reservation payments from our customers for purposes of securing their vehicle production slot. Before scheduled delivery, the customer must select from a list of separately priced options. At this time, the previously paid reservation payment is credited against the final purchase price of the vehicle and the customer is required to remit the remaining balance due. These amounts are recorded as current liabilities until the time the vehicle is delivered. Our current reservation agreement for the Tesla Roadster provides that prior to locking in the production slot for the Tesla Roadster, reservation payments are refundable, less a cancellation fee of $250. After locking in the production slot, the reservation payments are not refundable. For the Model S, our current reservation agreements provide for a $50 cancellation fee until the customer selects options. Upon selection of options, the customer will make an additional reservation payment, following which the cancellation fee becomes $10,000. Amounts received by us as refundable reservation payments are not restricted as to their use by us. Upon delivery of the vehicle, the related reservation payments are recognized in automotive sales as part of the respective vehicle sale. As of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, refundable reservation payments in the amount of $37.3 million, $48.0 million and $24.8 million, respectively, were recorded as current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.
5. License Agreement
In May 2004, we entered into a license agreement with AC Propulsion, Inc. (“ACP”) and obtained a nonexclusive, nontransferable, perpetual license to ACP’s patented and proprietary designs, techniques and methods that relate to electric vehicle propulsion and integration.
As consideration under the license agreement, we paid a license fee of $0.5 million which was recorded in research and development expenses as technological feasibility of the product had not been established. We also agreed to purchase parts and services from ACP totaling a minimum of $0.2 million over a two-year period. As of September 30, 2009, we had met the minimum purchase requirements.
In addition, ACP will be paid a royalty on all vehicle sales through December 31, 2014. The royalty will equal 0.25% of the vehicle’s manufacturer suggested retail price for every qualifying vehicle sold. We have the right to pay a lump sum equal to $5.0 million, minus royalties paid to date, in lieu of all future royalties at any time. During 2006, 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2009, we recorded royalty expenses of $0, $0, $28,000, $0 and $0.1 million, respectively, which were recorded in cost of sales.

Ranking
The convertible preferred stock ranks senior to all common stock. The Series F convertible preferred stock is the most senior series of preferred stock followed in order of preference by the Series E, D, C, B and A convertible preferred stock.
Dividends
The holders of all series of the convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive non-cumulative dividends at the per annum rate of 6% of the original issue price of such stock in the order of their preference, when and if declared by the Board of Directors. No dividends on the convertible preferred stock or common stock have been declared by the Board of Directors from inception through September 30, 2009.
Voting Rights
For all voting matters other than for the Board of Directors, the holders of each series of convertible preferred stock vote equally with shares of common stock on an as-converted basis. The authorized size of the Board of Directors is set at 11 members. Of these members, three members are elected by the holders of the Series A and Series B, voting together as a single class; one member is elected by the holders of the Series C; two members are elected by the holders of the Series D; one member is elected by the holders of the Series F; three members are elected by the holders of the common stock; and one member is elected by the holders of the common stock and convertible preferred stock voting together as a single class.
Optional Conversion
Each share of convertible preferred stock may be converted, at the option of the holder, at any time into common stock as is determined by dividing the applicable original issue price by the conversion price as adjusted for certain dilutive issuances, splits and combinations.
The following table summarizes the original issuance price and the applicable conversion price of all series of convertible preferred stock, as adjusted for certain dilutive issuances:
 
 	  	Original
Issuance

underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 in which we receive aggregate net cash proceeds of no less than $50.0 million and with a pre-public offering market capitalization of at least $250.0 million and (b) the date specified by written consent or agreement of the holders of at least two-thirds of the then outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock voting together as a single class on an as-converted basis.
Liquidation
Upon any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Tesla, the holders of all series of the convertible preferred stock are entitled to the payment of the following liquidation preferences, plus any accrued dividends:

Series C

  	 	1.135
Series D

  	 	2.440
Series E

  	 	2.512
Series F

  	 	2.969
With respect to the payment of the liquidation preference amounts described above, a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Tesla shall be deemed to occur if we: (i) sell, convey, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our property or business or merge with or into or consolidate with any other corporation, company or entity; or (ii) effect a transaction in which fifty percent or more of the voting power of Tesla is disposed of or converted into securities of another corporation, company or entity.
In the event of a deemed liquidation, dissolution or winding up of Tesla, the holders of all series of the convertible preferred stock are entitled to receive an amount equal to all declared but unpaid dividends for preferred stock, prior and in preference to any distribution of assets or surplus funds of Tesla to any holders of the common stock. If the assets and funds legally available for distribution among the holders of preferred stock are insufficient to permit payment in full to each holder of the convertible preferred stock, then the entire assets and funds of Tesla legally available for distribution shall be distributed to the holders of Series F, then ratably to the holders of Series E, then ratably to the holders of the Series D, then ratably to the holder of Series C, then ratably to the holders of Series B, and then ratably to the holders of Series A. After payment of the full liquidation preference to the holders of the convertible preferred stock, the remaining assets of Tesla shall be ratably distributed to the holders of common stock and convertible preferred stock on an as-if-converted basis. These liquidity features cause our convertible preferred stock to be classified as mezzanine capital rather than as a component of stockholders’ deficit.
Redemption
The convertible preferred stock is not redeemable by us or at the option of the preferred stockholders.
7. Convertible Notes Payable
As of December 31, 2008, we had $54.5 million of convertible notes payable outstanding. We had no convertible notes payable outstanding as of September 30, 2009.

March 2006 Convertible Notes Payable Facility
In March 2006, we entered into an agreement with certain lenders under which we were entitled to draw up to $5.0 million in exchange for warrants and secured convertible notes payable. We received $3.0 million for the issuance of the notes and warrants in March 2006. The notes were interest bearing at 8% per annum, were secured by a first priority security interest in all our personal property and were convertible into securities issuable in the next round of financing at the per share price of such financing. Upon the closing of the Series C convertible preferred stock financing in June 2006, the principal amount and accrued interest of the notes totaling $3.0 million was converted into 2,632,627 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock at a conversion price of $1.135 per share. Simultaneously with the Series C financing, warrants for the purchase of 650,822 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock were issued to the note holders. The warrants have an exercise price of $1.135 and expire on the earlier of March 30, 2011 or an initial public offering. The fair value of the warrants upon issuance in the amount of $0.4 million was initially recorded as a discount to the carrying value of the notes payable to be amortized over the draw down period. However, our right to draw down the remaining $2.0 million under the agreement expired upon the closing of the Series C convertible preferred stock financing in June 2006 and, therefore, the remaining discount was amortized through interest expense at that time. As such, we recognized additional interest expense in the amount of $0.4 million during 2006 related to these convertible notes payable.
February 2008 Convertible Notes Payable Facility
In February 2008, we received proceeds of $40.3 million through the issuance of convertible notes payable and warrants. These convertible notes payable were secured by all of our personal and intellectual property, and accrued interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The principal and related interest was due and payable on December 31, 2010, unless earlier converted into shares of our convertible preferred stock. The convertible notes payable were convertible at the election of the note holder into either the securities issuable in a subsequent round of financing at the per share price of such financing, or into Series D convertible preferred stock at a per share price of $2.44.
In connection with the February 2008 convertible notes payable, we issued warrants to purchase shares of either Series D convertible preferred stock at a price of $2.44 per share, which amounted to warrants to purchase 8,246,914 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock, or the securities issuable in a subsequent round of financing at the per share price of such securities. The warrants are exercisable, on or before the earlier of December 31, 2010 or an initial public offering. The warrants were recorded as a discount to the carrying value of the convertible notes in the amount of $0.2 million to be amortized to interest expense over the repayment period.
December 2008 Convertible Notes Payable Facility
In December 2008, we received proceeds of $14.5 million through the issuance of additional convertible notes payable. These convertible notes payable were secured by all of our personal and intellectual property and accrued interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The principal and related interest was due and payable on December 31, 2010, unless earlier converted into our convertible preferred stock upon the closing of a subsequent round of financing. The conversion price of these convertible notes was equal to 40% of the price of the shares sold in the subsequent round of financing.
Investors who participated in the February 2008 convertible note offering were eligible to exchange the convertible notes and warrants purchased in February 2008 for December 2008 convertible notes if certain conditions were met. Under these terms, the February 2008 convertible note holders exchanged $16.8 million of

February 2008 convertible notes and warrants for $16.8 million of December 2008 convertible notes upon the initial closing in December 2008.
As of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding convertible notes under the February 2008 convertible note facility in the amount of $23.4 million and had accrued interest on the February 2008 convertible notes in the amount of $3.5 million. Also as of December 31, 2008, we had outstanding convertible notes under the December 2008 convertible note facility in the amount of $31.3 million and had accrued interest on the December 2008 convertible notes in the amount of $28,000. During 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2008, we recognized $76,000 and $54,000, respectively, as interest expense as a result of the amortization of the debt discount. The carrying value for all of our convertible notes outstanding as of December 31, 2008 in the amount of $54.7 million was reduced by the remaining debt discount in the amount of $0.2 million on the consolidated balance sheet.
In February and March 2009, we received additional proceeds of $25.5 million through the issuance of additional convertible notes payable under the December 2008 convertible notes payable facility. In addition, the February 2008 convertible note holders exchanged another $19.1 million of February 2008 convertible notes and warrants for $19.1 million of December 2008 convertible notes during these subsequent closings in February and March 2009. The convertible notes issued in February and March 2009 contained the same terms as the convertible notes payable issued in December 2008.
In May 2009, we completed a qualified financing in which $50.0 million of proceeds was received for the purchase of 19,901,290 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock at a price of $2.51 per share. In connection with this financing, the principal amount of all of our convertible notes outstanding in the amount of $80.2 million, consisting of the remaining outstanding February 2008 convertible notes that carried a principal balance of $4.3 million and the outstanding December 2008 convertible notes carrying a principal balance of $75.9 million, and accrued interest from these convertible notes in the amount of $6.1 million was converted into 82,875,489 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase 866,091 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. Therefore, there were no convertible notes outstanding as of September 30, 2009. In addition, the remaining debt discount related to the warrants issued with the February 2008 convertible notes was eliminated through interest expense at the time of the conversion and, therefore, we recognized interest expense in the amount of $172,000 related to these warrants during the nine months ended September 30, 2009.
8. Convertible Preferred Stock Warrants
In March 2006, we issued warrants to purchase 650,882 shares of Series C convertible preferred stock in conjunction with the issuance of the March 2006 convertible notes payable (see Note 7). The warrants have an exercise price of $1.135 per share and expire on the earlier of March 30, 2011 or an initial public offering. We calculated the fair value of the warrants on the date of issue using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility of 62.5%, expected term of five years, risk-free interest rate of 4.8% and dividend yield of 0%. We recorded the issuance date fair value of the warrants in the amount of $0.4 million as warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet to be marked to fair value each reporting period. As of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, the fair value of warrants to purchase shares of the Series C convertible preferred stock in the amount of $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.5 million, respectively, was included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognized gains from the change in the fair value of the Series C warrants in the amounts of $0.2 million and $36,000 during 2006 and 2007 and charges in the amounts of $0.1 million and $0.2 million during 2008 and the

nine months ended September 30, 2009 through other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations.
In February 2008, we issued warrants with the February 2008 convertible notes payable (see Note 7). The warrants allowed for the purchase of shares of either Series D convertible preferred stock at a price of $2.44 per share, which amounted to warrants to purchase 8,246,914 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock, or the securities issuable in a subsequent round of financing at the per share price of such securities. The warrants expire on the earlier of December 31, 2010 or a qualified initial public offering. These warrants also allow for net settlement at the option of the holder. We calculated the fair value of the warrants on the date of issue under the assumption that the warrants would be exercisable for Series D convertible preferred stock using the Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: volatility of 60%, expected term of 0.7 years, risk-free interest rate of 2.0% and dividend yield of 0%. We recorded the issuance date fair value of the warrants in the amount of $0.3 million as a liability on the consolidated balance sheet.
On December 24, 2008, warrants to purchase 3,439,305 of the shares of Series D convertible preferred stock were extinguished as a result of the election of certain holders of the February 2008 convertible notes to exchange their notes and warrants for December 2008 convertible notes (see Note 7). On the date of the exchange, we recognized a gain in the amount of $1.3 million through other income (expense), net for the extinguishment of these warrants. As of December 31, 2008, the fair value of the remaining warrants to purchase 4,807,609 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock in the amount of $1.7 million was included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet.
During the nine months ended September 30, 2009, warrants to purchase an additional 3,967,152 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock were extinguished as a result of the election of certain remaining holders of the February 2008 convertible notes as part of an exchange of their notes and warrants for December 2008 convertible notes. On the date of the exchange, we recognized a gain in the amount of $1.5 million through other income (expense), net for the extinguishment of these warrants.
In May 2009, we completed our Series E financing in which $50.0 million of proceeds was received for the purchase of 19,901,290 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock at a price of $2.51 per share. In connection with this financing, the remaining holders of the February 2008 notes and warrants converted their notes into shares of Series E convertible preferred stock and warrants to purchase 866,091 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock.
As of September 30, 2009, the fair value of warrants to purchase 866,091 shares of the Series E convertible preferred stock in the amount of $0.5 million was included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the consolidated balance sheet. We recognized a charge for the change in the fair value of the Series E warrants in the amount of $0.2 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2009 through other income (expense), net on the consolidated statement of operations.
As of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, there were total outstanding warrants to purchase 650,882 shares of Series C, 5,458,491 shares of Series C and D, and 1,516,973 shares of Series C and E, respectively, of our convertible preferred stock that had a weighted average exercise price of $1.14, $2.28 and $1.92 per share, respectively.
9. Common Stock
As of September 30, 2009, we were authorized to issue 483,006,077 shares of capital stock with a par value of $0.001 per share. The authorized shares consist of 270,000,000 shares of common stock and 213,006,077 shares of convertible preferred stock.

In November 2007, the chairman of our Board of Directors converted 8,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred stock to 8,000,000 shares of common stock.
Early Exercise of Employee Options
Stock options granted under our stock option plan provide certain employee option holders the right to elect to exercise unvested options in exchange for shares of restricted common stock. Unvested shares, in the amounts of 920,748, 277,322 and 178,943 as of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, respectively, were subject to a repurchase right held by us at the original issuance price in the event the optionees’ employment is terminated either voluntarily or involuntarily. For exercises of employee options, this right generally lapses as to  1/4th of the shares subject to the option on the first anniversary of the vesting start date and as to  1/48th of the shares monthly thereafter. These repurchase terms are considered to be a forfeiture provision and do not result in variable accounting. The restricted shares issued upon early exercise of stock options are legally issued and outstanding and have been reflected in stockholders’ (deficit). However, these restricted shares are only deemed outstanding for basic earnings per share computation purposes upon the respective repurchase rights lapsing. We treat cash received from employees for the exercise of unvested options as a refundable deposit shown as a liability in its consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, we included cash received for early exercise of options of $0.2 million, $64,000 and $49,000, respectively, in accrued liabilities. Amounts from accrued liabilities are transferred into common stock and additional paid-in capital as the shares vest.
10. Equity Incentive Plans
In July 2003, we adopted the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan provides for the granting of stock options and stock purchase rights to employees, directors and consultants of Tesla. Options granted under the Plan may be either incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options (“ISO”) may be granted only to our employees including officers and directors. Nonqualified stock options (“NSO”) and stock purchase rights may be granted to our employees and consultants. As of December 31, 2008, there were 17,138,740 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the Plan.
Options under the Plan may be granted at prices no less than 85% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as determined by the Board of Directors, provided, however, that (i) the exercise price of an ISO and NSO shall not be less than 100% or 85% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant, respectively, and (ii) the exercise price of an ISO and NSO granted to a 10% shareholder shall not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant, respectively. The fair value of the shares is determined by the Board of Directors on the date of grants and the stock options generally have a contractual life of 7 years. Options become exercisable at the rate of no less than 20% per year over five years from the date of grants, except for options granted to officers, directors and consultants which typically become exercisable at the rate of no less than 25% after one year and vest monthly thereafter for the next 36 months.
In October 2008, we modified the vesting of 1,530,169 stock options granted during 2007 and 2008 such that the first year of vesting was on a monthly basis. This transaction was accounted for as a modification and did not have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet, statements of operations or cash flows.

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between our common stock price and the exercise price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options. The aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009 was $1.8 million and $2.4 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of options exercisable was $1.3 million and $2.1 million, and the intrinsic value of options vested and expected to vest was $1.7 million and $2.3 million as of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $7,000, $0.2 million, $1.4 million, $0.2 million for 2006, 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively.
Fair Value Adoption
We adopted the fair value method on January 1, 2006 in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimated the fair value of each option award on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table.

We based expected volatility on the historical volatility of a peer group of publicly traded entities over a period equal to the expected terms of the options as we did not have a sufficient trading history to use the volatility of its own common stock. The expected term of options represents the period that our options are expected to be outstanding. Given the limited history to accurately estimate the expected terms of options granted to the various employee groups, we used the “simplified” method as provided by the Securities and Exchange Commission. We qualify for the use of the “simplified” method because the stock options granted during 2006, 2007 and 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 are considered to be “plain vanilla”. The “simplified” method is calculated as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury Constant Maturity rate as of the date of grant.
The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options has historically been determined by the Board of Directors. Because there has been no public market for our common stock, the Board of Directors has determined fair value of the common stock at the time of each grant of options by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including valuation of comparable companies, sales of convertible preferred stock to unrelated third parties, operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of capital stock, and trends in the broader automobile industry. We have not granted stock options with an exercise price that is less than the fair value of the underlying common stock as determined at the time of grant by our Board of Directors, with input from management. The fair market value of the underlying common stock shall be determined by the Board of Directors until such time as our common stock is listed on an established stock exchange or national market system.

Information regarding our stock option grants during 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, including the grant date; the number of stock options issued with each grant; and the exercise price, which equals the grant date fair value of the underlying common stock for each grant of stock options, is summarized as follows:

We calculated employee stock-based compensation expense for 2006, 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 based on awards ultimately expected to vest as reduced for estimated forfeitures. The fair value method requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. We estimate our forfeiture rate based on an analysis of its actual forfeitures and will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover behavior, and other factors. The impact from a forfeiture rate adjustment will be recognized in full in the period of adjustment, and if the actual number of future forfeitures differs from that estimated by us, we may be required to record adjustments to stock-based compensation expense in future periods. For 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we estimated our forfeiture rates to be 21% and 15%, respectively.
Each of the inputs discussed above is subjective and generally requires significant management and director judgment to determine.
The following table summarizes the consolidated stock-based compensation expense by line items in the consolidated statement of operations (in thousands):

We realized no income tax benefit from stock option exercises in each of the periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances. As required, we present excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, if any, as financing cash flows rather than operating cash flows.

As of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, we had $1.1 million, $1.0 million, and $2.1 million, respectively, of total unrecognized compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.2, 3.2 and 3.0 years, respectively.
Non-employee Stock Options
During 2006, 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we granted options to purchase 20,000, 1,610,000, 110,000 and 15,000 shares of common stock, respectively, to non-employees at exercise prices ranging from $0.10 to $0.98 per share. Included within these grants was 0, 850,000, 100,000 and 0 shares that were granted outside of the Plan during 2006, 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, respectively, at exercise prices ranging from $0.60 to $0.90 per share.
We determined the estimated fair value of non-employee options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the following weighted average assumptions for 2006, 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009:

11. Income Taxes
No provision for U.S. income taxes has been made, net of the valuation allowance, due to cumulative losses since the commencement of operations.
A provision for income taxes of $0.1 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million has been recognized for 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively, and a benefit from income taxes of $0.2 million has been recognized for the nine months ended September 30, 2009 related to our subsidiaries located in the United Kingdom and Taiwan.

Management believes that based on the available information, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, such that a full valuation allowance is required against all U.S. deferred tax assets.
As of December 31, 2008, we had approximately $183 million of federal and $161 million of California operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income which expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024 for federal and 2019 for state if unused. Additionally, we have research and development tax credits of approximately $3.9 million and $3.7 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal carry-forwards will expire in various amounts beginning in 2019, and the state credits can be carried forward indefinitely.
As of December 31, 2008, we also have approximately $0.4 million of operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income in the United Kingdom which can be carried forward indefinitely.
Federal and state laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have determined that ownership changes occurred in 2004 and 2006 due to significant stock transactions. The utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards will not be materially impacted as no significant limitation will be placed on these carry-forwards.
Uncertain Tax Positions
Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted new accounting guidance related to the recognition, measurement and presentation of uncertain tax positions. As a result, we recorded net unrecognized tax benefits of $11.5 million with an offset to the deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance.

The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits during 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009 were as follows (in thousands):

  	$	15,505
  	 	 
Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and was zero. As of September 30, 2009, unrecognized tax benefits of $15.5 million, if recognized, would not affect our effective tax rate as the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which is currently fully offset with a full valuation allowance. We do not anticipate that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. We file income tax returns in the United States, California, various states, the United Kingdom and other foreign jurisdictions. Tax years 2006 to 2008 remain subject to examination for federal purposes, and tax years 2005 to 2008 remain subject to examination for California purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U.S. federal and California purposes. Tax years 2005 to 2008 remain open for examination in other U.S. state and foreign jurisdictions.

13. Employee Benefit Plans
We sponsor a 401(k) defined contribution plan covering all employees. Contributions made by us are determined annually by the Board of Directors. There were no contributions made by us to the plan from inception through September 30, 2009.
14. Related Party Transactions
In December 2006, we issued a promissory note of $40,000 to an executive. The note accrued interest at 5% per annum. The note together with accrued interest of $2,000 was forgiven in December 2007 and was recognized in the consolidated statement of operations as a component of sales and marketing expenses.
Our Chief Executive Officer acquired two Tesla Roadsters during the nine months ended September 30, 2009. Because the vehicles were delivered just prior to period end but were not paid for until after the period end, we had outstanding accounts receivable related to the sale of these vehicles in the amount of $0.3 million as of September 30, 2009. This outstanding balance was paid in its entirety during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2009.
During 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, SpaceX, a related party, paid for certain of our facility and service costs for which we would subsequently reimburse SpaceX for all such payments. SpaceX is a related party as a result of the ability of our Chief Executive Officer to influence both organizations through ownership interest and Board of Director representation in both. Total fees paid to SpaceX during 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2009 were $0, $300, $300 and $0.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, 2008 and September 30, 2009, accrued amounts payable to SpaceX were $300, $0 and $0.1 million, respectively.
We are providing development services for an affiliate of a significant stockholder. In May 2009, we sold 19,901,290 shares of Series E convertible preferred stock to Blackstar Investco LLC, an affiliate of Daimler, for aggregate proceeds of $50.0 million. Also in May 2009, we and Daimler formalized a development arrangement under which we were performing powertrain development activities since 2008. During 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2009, we received payments from Daimler in the amount of $10.2 million and $11.1 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, there was an amount receivable of $1.6 million from Daimler. There was no receivable or payable balance outstanding with Daimler as of September 30, 2009.
15. Commitments
Operating Lease
We lease office space under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through August 2016. Rent expense for 2006, 2007, 2008 and the nine months ended September 30, 2008 and 2009 was $0.7 million, $2.2 million, $1.5 million, $1.0 million and $1.9 million, respectively.
Capital Lease
We have entered into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases over terms between 12 and 60 months. The equipment under the leases are collateral for the lease obligations and are included within property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet in the categories computer equipment and software and office furniture and equipment.

Non-cancellable inventory and service related purchase commitments outstanding as of September 30, 2009 amounted to $10.5 million and will be settled over the ensuing 26 months. In addition, pursuant to a supply agreement with Lotus Cars Limited, we are required to purchase a minimum of 1,700 partially assembled vehicles or gliders over the three year term of the agreement regardless of whether we are able to market and distribute the Tesla Roadster. Based on the foreign exchange rate for the British pound as of September 30, 2009 and the most recent price per vehicle, the estimated obligation for the remaining purchase minimum is approximately $20 million which will primarily occur in 2010.
As of December 31, 2008 and September 30, 2009, we were in possession of refundable reservation payments in the amount of $48.0 million and $24.8 million, respectively, from subscribers (see Note 4).

16. Subsequent Events
On January 20, 2010, we entered into a loan agreement with the United States Federal Financing Bank (“FFB”), and the DOE, pursuant to the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program (“ATVM”) (the “DOE Loan Facility”). Under the DOE Loan Facility, up to an aggregate principal amount of $101.2 million will be made available under the first term loan facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding for the build out of a facility to design and manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and electric components, or the Powertrain facility. Up to an aggregate principal amount of $363.9 million will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding for the development of, and to build out the manufacturing facility for, our Model S sedan, or the Model S facility. Under the DOE Loan Facility, we are responsible for the remaining 20% of the costs eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the projects as well as any cost overruns for each project. The costs paid by us to date for the Powertrain facility and the Model S facility will be applied towards our obligation to contribute 20% of the eligible project costs, and the DOE’s funding of future eligible costs will be adjusted to take this into account. Our remaining obligations for these projects are estimated to be an aggregate of $33 million, plus any cost overruns for the projects.
Our ability to draw down funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon several draw conditions. For the Powertrain facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain manufacturing facility and the successful development of commercial arrangements with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. For the Model S facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones relating to the design and development of the Model S and the planned Model S manufacturing facility, including an environmental assessment of such facility approved by the DOE. Certain advances will be subject to additional conditions to draw-down related to the site on which the applicable project is located.
Advances under the DOE Loan Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the date of the advance and will be based on the Treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal installments for such advance. Interest on advances under the DOE Loan Facility is payable quarterly in arrears.
Under the DOE Loan Facility, we have committed to pay all costs and expenses incurred to complete the projects being financed in excess of amounts funded under the loan facility. We will be required to maintain, at all times, available cash and cash equivalents of at least 105% of the amounts required to fund this excess over our financing commitment, after taking into account current cash flows and cash on hand, and reasonable projections of future generation of net cash from operations, losses and expenditures. Loans may be requested under the facilities until January 22, 2013, and we have committed to complete the projects being financed prior to such date. On the closing date, we paid a facility fee to the DOE in the amount of $0.5 million. We intend to receive the first draw-down under each facility starting in the first quarter of 2010.
The DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among others, a requirement that the projects be conducted in accordance with the business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the ATVM Program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business, and enter into certain restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities, and

(i) through December 15, 2012, a minimum cash balance, and (ii) after December 15, 2012, a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a limit on capital expenditures and, after March 31, 2014, a maximum ratio of total liabilities to shareholder equity.
Under the DOE Loan Facility, we are required to fund a debt service reserve account on or before December 31, 2012, in an amount equal to all principal and interest that will come due on the advances on the next two payment dates. Once we have deposited such two payments, we will not be required to further fund such debt service reserve account. We have also agreed that, in connection with the sale of our common stock in an initial public offering, at least 75% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us and, in connection with the sale of our stock in any other follow-on equity offering, at least 50% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us. Additionally, we are restricted in our ability to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers, directors, employees or consultants.
In addition to our obligation to fund a portion of the project costs as described above, we have agreed to set aside 50% of the net proceeds from an initial public offering and any subsequent offerings of stock occurring before the completion of the projects, up to an aggregate of $100 million, to fund a separate, dedicated account under our DOE Loan Facility. We will use amounts deposited into this dedicated account to fund project costs of the Powertrain Facility and the Model S Facility which would have otherwise been funded through advances made under the DOE Loan Facility such that, while there are funds available in the dedicated account, for each dollar of project costs advanced under the DOE Loan Facility, one dollar of project costs that would otherwise have been funded under the DOE Loan Facility will be funded from the dedicated account. The dedicated account can also be used by us to fund any cost overruns for these projects. Once the funds deposited into this dedicated account have been used in full, we will be reimbursed by the drawdown of additional funds for amounts paid from this account, and we will be required to deposit a portion of these reimbursements into the dedicated account in an amount equal to up to 30% of the remaining project costs for the applicable project. These amounts will similarly be used to fund project costs and cost overruns and will similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the drawdown of additional funds once used in full.
In connection with the DOE Loan Facility, we have also issued the DOE a warrant to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our Series E Preferred Stock. Beginning on December 15, 2018 and until December 14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will vest and become exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the prior quarter. The warrant may be exercised until December 15, 2023. If we prepay the DOE Loan Facility in part or in full, the total amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be reduced. Since the number of shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrants will vary, this warrant will be carried at its estimated fair value with changes in fair value reflected in other income (expense), net, until its expiration or exercise.
In October 2009, we increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan from 17,138,740 shares to 22,138,740 shares of common stock. In December 2009, we increased the number of shares reserved for issuance under the Equity Incentive Plan from 22,138,740 shares to 42,238,740 shares of common stock.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
(continued)
 
In December 2009, 20,135,920 stock options were granted to our Chief Executive Officer comprised of two grants. In recognition of his and our company’s achievements and to create incentives for future success, the Board of Directors approved, an option grant representing 4% of our fully-diluted share base as of December 4, 2009, or 10,067,960 stock options, with  1/4th of the shares vesting immediately, and  1/48th of the shares scheduled to vest each month over the subsequent three years, assuming continued employment through each vesting date. In addition, to create incentives for the attainment of clear performance objectives around a key element of our current business plan—the successful launch and commercialization of the Model S—the Board of Directors approved additional options totaling an additional 4% of our fully-diluted shares as of December 4, 2009, or 10,067,960 stock options, with  1/4th of the shares to vest based entirely on the attainment of each of four performance milestones, assuming continued employment through each vesting date. If Mr. Musk does not meet one or more of the above milestones prior to the fourth anniversary of the date of grant, he will forfeit his right to the unvested portion of the grant.
In December 2009, the Board of Directors authorized the filing of a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of our common stock.
We have evaluated subsequent events from October 1, 2009 through January 29, 2010, the date of the filing of the financial statements.

Item 14.	Indemnification of Directors and Officers.
Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law authorizes a corporation’s board of directors to grant, and authorizes a court to award, indemnity to officers, directors and other corporate agents.
As permitted by Section 102(b)(7) of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the registrant’s certificate of incorporation to be in effect upon the closing of this offering includes provisions that eliminate the personal liability of its directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty as directors. To the extent Section 102(b)(7) is interpreted, or the Delaware General Corporation Law is amended, to allow similar protections for officers of a corporation, such provisions of the registrant’s certificate of incorporation shall also extend to those persons.
In addition, as permitted by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, the bylaws of the registrant to be effective upon completion of this offering provide that:
 
 	•	 	
The registrant shall indemnify its directors and officers for serving the registrant in those capacities or for serving other business enterprises at the registrant’s request, to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Delaware law provides that a corporation may indemnify such person if such person acted in good faith and in a manner such person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the registrant and, with respect to any criminal proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe such person’s conduct was unlawful.

 
 	•	 	
The registrant may, in its discretion, indemnify employees and agents in those circumstances where indemnification is permitted by applicable law.

 
 	•	 	
The registrant is required to advance expenses, as incurred, to its directors and officers in connection with defending a proceeding, except that such director or officer shall undertake to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

 
 	•	 	
The registrant will not be obligated pursuant to the bylaws to indemnify a person with respect to proceedings initiated by that person, except with respect to proceedings authorized by the registrant’s board of directors or brought to enforce a right to indemnification.

 
 	•	 	
The rights conferred in the bylaws are not exclusive, and the registrant is authorized to enter into indemnification agreements with its directors, officers, employees and agents and to obtain insurance to indemnify such persons.

 
II-1
Table of Contents

 	•	 	
The registrant may not retroactively amend the bylaw provisions to reduce its indemnification obligations to directors, officers, employees and agents.

The registrant’s policy is to enter into separate indemnification agreements with each of its directors and officers that provide the maximum indemnity allowed to directors and executive officers by Section 145 of the Delaware General Corporation Law and also provides for certain additional procedural protections. The registrant also maintains directors and officers insurance to insure such persons against certain liabilities.
These indemnification provisions and the indemnification agreements entered into between the registrant and its officers and directors may be sufficiently broad to permit indemnification of the registrant’s officers and directors for liabilities (including reimbursement of expenses incurred) arising under the Securities Act of 1933.
The underwriting agreement filed as Exhibit 1.1 to this registration statement provides for indemnification by the underwriters of the registrant and its officers and directors for certain liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 and otherwise.

Table of Contents

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of 1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of the registrant pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise, the registrant has been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by the registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director, officer or controlling person of the registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act of 1933 and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.
The undersigned registrant hereby undertakes that:
(1) For purposes of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, the information omitted from the form of prospectus filed as part of this registration statement in reliance upon Rule 430A and contained in a form of prospectus filed by the registrant pursuant to Rule 424(b)(1) or (4) or 497(h) under the Securities Act shall be deemed to be part of this registration statement as of the time it was declared effective.
(2) For the purpose of determining any liability under the Securities Act of 1933, each post effective amendment that contains a form of prospectus shall be deemed to be a new registration statement relating to the securities offered therein, and the offering of such securities at that time shall be deemed to be the initial bona fide offering thereof.
