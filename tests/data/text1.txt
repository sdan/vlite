Manage Work 43\nagile engineering approach now more common than \never, where all team members are required to be \npresent in the meeting (not just the team lead), it is \nvery important for us to utilize meetings properly. \nBecause of the large number of attendees, meeting \ninefficiency wastes a lot of time for everyone.\nIn most cases, we can actually discuss a lot of \ninformation in 30 minutes. TED talk videos are a \ngreat example of how a lot of information can be \nshared in a short time. TED talks only last for 18 \nminutes (standard format for a TED presentation).\nFor example, there is a TED talk video by Dr Atul \nGawande of Harvard Medical School that discusses \nthe importance of checklists in avoiding mistakes. \nIn just 18 minutes, Dr Gawande provides a lot of \ninformation, with examples and supporting data, in \na very compelling manner.\nIn his talk Dr Gawande discusses two types of \nmistakes. The first type is an error of ignorance \nwhere we make a mistake because we know too \nlittle. This type of mistake can be cured through \ntraining. The second type is an error where we \ndo not properly use what we already know. \nDr Gawande reasons that the second type of mistakes \nare common because the volume and complexity of \nknowledge today is very large. For most of us, the \nvolume and complexity of knowledge exceeds our \nability to consistently deliver it correctly and safely. \nBy using proper checklists, we can dramatically \nreduce the instances of the second type of mistakes. \nDr Gawande mentions how he helped create a 2-', 'Notes\n1.
